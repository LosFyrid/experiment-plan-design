entities
Entities:
  - Name: low-angle_grain_boundary(LAGB)
    Information: The low-angle grain boundary (LAGB), also referred to as a sub-grain boundary, occurs when the misorientation between two grains is 15 degrees or less.
  - Name: tilt_low-angle_grain_boundary
    Information: In tilt boundaries, the dislocations are primarily edge dislocations, with Burgers vectors perpendicular to the boundary plane and line directions aligned with the rotational axis.
  - Name: twist_low-angle_grain_boundary
    Information: On the other hand, twist boundaries consist of screw dislocations with Burgers vectors lying within the boundary plane.

  - Name: duplex_stainless_steel_2205(DSS_2205)
    Information: The primary mechanism for the migration of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) in DSS 2205 (Duplex Stainless Steel 2205) is the climb and glide of the boundary's dislocations.
  - Name: dislocation_structure
    Information: These boundaries are characterized by a periodic arrangement of dislocations, which play a crucial role in the design and configuration of dislocation structures.

  - Name: high_angle_grain_boundary
    Information: Not every high-angle grain boundary has an open, chaotic structure; certain high-angle boundaries may have slightly lower energies than ordinary random boundaries in rare instances.
  - Name: special_high_angle_grain_boundary
    Information: Certain high-angle boundaries may have slightly lower energies than ordinary random boundaries when particular misorientations and boundary planes allow the two adjacent crystal lattices to align in a way that reduces interatomic bond distortion.
  - Name: twin_boundary
    Information: Twin boundaries are one of the most basic types of special high-angle boundaries, where the orientation of the two grains across the boundary is related by a mirror symmetry, and when parallel to the twinning axis, atoms integrate perfectly into both lattices with minimum deformation.
  - Name: twinning
    Information: Twining occurs when the orientation of the two grains across a twin boundary is the same as their identical counterpart, producing a symmetric crystallographic relationship.
  - Name: grain_boundary_sliding
    Information: Grain boundary sliding occurs during superplastic deformation and enhances grain boundary mobility.
  - Name: sigma_phase_precipitation
    Information: Sigma phase precipitation is adversely affected by grain boundary sliding, causing some of it to precipitate on twin borders with lesser mobility.
  - Name: boundary_energy
    Information: The energy associated with a grain boundary is lowered when the boundary structure is more organized and stable due to favorable lattice alignment.
  - Name: interatomic_bond_distortion

  - Name: climb
    Information: The primary mechanism for the migration of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) in DSS 2205 (Duplex Stainless Steel 2205) is the climb and glide of the boundary's dislocations.
  - Name: glide
    Information: The primary mechanism for the migration of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) in DSS 2205 (Duplex Stainless Steel 2205) is the climb and glide of the boundary's dislocations.
  - Name: dislocation_theory
    Information: Dislocation theory thus provides an effective explanation for the behaviour of LAGB migration.
  - Name: high-angle_grain_boundary
    Information: In contrast to high-angle grain boundaries, low-angle grain boundaries have been found to have substantially less mobility [133].
  - Name: isothermal_annealing
    Information: The migration mechanism of LAGBs is characterized by a constant rate of movement, indicating that a given boundary's mobility stays constant during isothermal annealing.
  - Name: bulk_diffusion
    Information: Bulk diffusion governs this behaviour, which means that atoms' diffusion within the bulk material, as opposed to at the surface, controls the migration of LAGBs.
  - Name: dislocation_density
    Information: Because of the increased dislocation density and, consequently, higher internal stress within the boundary region, the energy of the boundary tends to increase with the misorientation angle [145].
  - Name: internal_stress
    Information: Because of the increased dislocation density and, consequently, higher internal stress within the boundary region, the energy of the boundary tends to increase with the misorientation angle [145].
  - Name: boundary_mobility
    Information: The connection between misorientation and boundary mobility is a notable feature of LAGB migration. This suggests that LAGBs can migrate more quickly and are more mobile when their misorientation angles are higher.

  - Name: efficiency
    Values: microstructure: 35%
    Information: The efficiency percentage of the material under specific conditions, as measured in the study.
  - Name: flow_stress
    Values: 2205_duplex_stainless_steel: rises with lower temperatures and higher strain rates
    Information: The stress required for material deformation, which varies with temperature and strain rate.
  - Name: effect_on_properties
    Values: 2205_duplex_stainless_steel: Increase the strain rate up to 0.5 s^-1, and enhanced the hot ductility of the 2205 duplex stainless steel, as assessed by total elongation and area reduction, due to microstructural modifications that reduced the hardness differential between the ferrite and austenite phases.
            ferrite: The continuous dynamic recrystallization of ferrite was substantially activated in the flow stability region
            austenite: both continuous and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization in austenite were weak
            microstructural_modifications: due to microstructural modifications that reduced the hardness differential between the ferrite and austenite phases
            continuous_dynamic_recrystallization: The continuous dynamic recrystallization of ferrite was substantially activated in the flow stability region
            discontinuous_dynamic_recrystallization: both continuous and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization in austenite were weak
            grain: Increasing temperature or strain rate causes the production of new grains not just at grain borders but also within the interiors of deformed grains. During dynamic recrystallization, grain size and fraction rise with temperature but have a non-linear relationship with strain rate. This improves the yield strength of the material.
            microcrack: A reduction in the fracture strain was observed as the strain rate increased. Temperature tests showed a decrease in strain to fracture with increasing temperature; Reducing the deformation temperature and increasing the strain rate resulted in less dynamic recrystallization in the ferrite, weaker softening of the two phases, and microcrack creation.
            microstructure: High strain rates (>5 s^-1) and low temperature (<972°C) resulted in a moderate efficiency (≈35%) despite an inhomogeneous microstructure and non-uniform mechanical characteristics.
            softening: weaker softening of the two phases
    Information: The textual description of the effects of testing conditions on material properties as described in the literature.

The long grains break apart at this point, forming new, high-angle, equiaxed grains roughly equal in all dimensions [ 121 ]. A stable, fine-grained structure can form inside the material because of the pinching-off process. GDRX creates a high-angle boundary network that resists dislocation movement better than low-angle boundaries [ 122 ].

    Information: Chromium ( 22 -23% ) is the element with the highest content in DSS and forms ferrite ( stabilizer ) .
  - Name: ferrite
    Information: Chromium ( 22 -23% ) is the element with the highest content in DSS and forms ferrite ( stabilizer ) .
  - Name: corrosion_resistance
    Information: Duplex stainless steel ' s corrosion resistance is attributed to its Cr concentration; if the content is lower than projected, the DSS ' s corrosion resistance will not be enough for corrosive environments like manufacturing facilities.
  - Name: sigma_phase(sigma)
    Information: A higher concentration of Cr in DSS caused the sigma to precipitate more, exposing the DSS to a heat history more akin to the heat-affect zone.
  - Name: heat_affect_zone
    Information: A higher concentration of Cr in DSS caused the sigma to precipitate more, exposing the DSS to a heat history more akin to the heat-affect zone.
  - Name: hardness
    Information: Additionally, the steel ' s hardness will increase [ 52 ] .
  - Name: passive_function
    Information: DSS 2205 needs at least 10.5 wt% Cr to generate a stable passive function for corrosion resistance, which improves with increasing concentration [ 53 ] .
  - Name: duplex_stainless_steel
    Information: Duplex stainless steels ( DSSs ) require at least 18 wt% Cr to preserve their two-phase structure.
  - Name: two_phase_structure
    Information: Duplex stainless steels ( DSSs ) require at least 18 wt% Cr to preserve their two-phase structure.

        Type: single
      Range:
        Entity: micro_cracking
        Type: single
      Restriction: some
    Information: Toughness is reduced by sigma phase formation due to network-like morphology promoting crack formation. Tensile strength is reduced by micro-cracking of sigma phase at 850°C causing low-stress failures [83]. Note: Low sigma phase volume fraction is not a reliable hardness indicator [82].

        Type: single
      Range:
        Entity: intermetallic_phase
        Type: single
      Restriction: some
    Information: Ferrite is consumed by intermetallic phase formation, reducing its content and causing embrittlement [82].

        Type: single
      Range:
        Entity: sigma_phase
        Type: single
      Restriction: some
    Information: Hardness increases with aging time across 650°C-975°C [10] and with higher sigma phase content [82]. Yield strength and tensile strength increase with sigma phase formation within 750°C-850°C [10]. Note: Tensile strength shows minimal changes with increased sigma phase at high annealing temperatures [83].
  - Name: is_caused_by
    Instance:
      Domain:
        Entity: embrittlement
        Type: single
      Range:
        Entity: intermetallic_phase
        Type: single
      Restriction: some
    Information: Embrittlement is caused by intermetallic phase formation consuming ferrite [82].

    Information: Hot deformation has a major impact on duplex stainless steel's mechanical properties and microstructure (DSS 2205). With a yield strength of 585-607 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 796-802 MPa, and fracture elongation of 28.4-32.8%, the two-stage solution (TSS) heat treatment procedure successfully balanced strength and plasticity in 2205 duplex stainless steel [145]. According to C Lei et al [168], the actual activation energy for hot deformation of 2205 DSS is roughly 451-452 kJ mol⁻¹.

        Type: single
      Restriction: some
    Information: At high temperatures (950-1150°C), austenite exhibits dynamic recrystallization (DRX), whereas ferrite exhibits dynamic recovery (DRV) [152, 166]. When distorted at 0.1-10 s⁻¹ at 950°C, the majority of ferrite undergoes continuous dynamic recrystallization and acquires a <001>//ND structure. Ferrite undergoes a phase transition from δ to γ when deformed at 0.01 s⁻¹/850°C-950°C [111]. Work hardening was seen in the early stages of deformation [173].

    Information: The production of intermetallic phases, particularly at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000 °C, can have a major impact on the mechanical and corrosion properties of duplex stainless steels (DSS) and super duplex stainless steels (SDSS) such as 2205, particularly during welding procedures. Even a small volume fraction of intermetallic phases, particularly the sigma phase, can significantly impair the toughness of DSS and SDSS due to their hard and brittle nature, resulting in embrittlement and lowering these materials' corrosion resistance.
