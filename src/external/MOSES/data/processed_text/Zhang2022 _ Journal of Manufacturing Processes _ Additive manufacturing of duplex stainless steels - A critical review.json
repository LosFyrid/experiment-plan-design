Fig.  1a  shows  the typical microstructure of DSSs. The ideal phase ratio ( α : γ ) is about 1:1, which provides an excellent combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance [1 -3]. DSSs have attracted more and more attentions  for  structures  in  corrosive  environment  such  as  ship  building, marine  engineering,  chemical  engineering,  paper,  pulp  and  petrochemical industries [4 -5]. It was reported that the percentage of DSSs in the  total  consumption  of  stainless  steels  worldwide  had  increased  4 times in the last 5 years [6]. It has been widely acknowledged that the competitivity of DSSs is increasingly rising up considering the market demand of high quality corrosion-resistant materials, the advancement of manufacturing technologies and the raw material pressure of nickel which has been a major element in austenite stainless steels (ASSs).\nAs shown in Fig. 1b, alloying elements in DSSs are divided into two categories: ferrite stabilizing elements such as Cr and Mo, and austenite",

        "content": "Duplex stainless steels (DSSs) are promising materials in many fields due to their excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties, which are resulted from their microstructure consisted of a roughly equal amount of austenite  and  ferrite  phases.  As  a  revolutionary  production  technology,  additive  manufacturing  (AM)  has exhibited tremendous advantages for the fabrication of metal parts of complicated or customized geometry. Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), laser metal deposition (LMD) and laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) have been utilized to fabricate DSSs. However, it is of a great challenge to achieve expected formation quality and microstructure at the same time, considering the complicated layer-upon-layer process. A delicate control of processing conditions is highly required based on the understanding of DSS materials and AM processes. In this work, an overview of the up-to-date research status and future perspectives on the AM of DSSs is presented from extensive viewpoints including materials, processing, microstructure and properties. The microstructure evolution during the AM processes is highlighted in detail, which explains the change of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, and provides the direction of processing optimization.\nstabilizing elements such as Ni and N [7]. The phase transformation tendency can be evaluated by the value of Creq/Nieq. A higher Creq/Nieq means a higher tendency to form ferrite, namely a lower tendency to form austenite. The Creq/Nieq of common DSSs ranges 1.7 -3 as shown in Table  1;  for  comparison,  it  is  approximately  1.6  for  304  austenite stainless steel [8 -10]. Besides the influence on phase transformation, the addition of alloying elements in DSSs contributes to solution strengthening effect. Cr improves corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. Mo  increases  corrosion  resistance  and  high  temperature  strength [11 -14]. The pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN) can evaluate the beneficial influence of alloying elements on the corrosion resistance as  shown  in  Eq.  (1)  [15].  A  higher  PREN  indicates  better  corrosion resistance.\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nAccording to the Fe -Cr -Ni pseudo-binary diagram in Fig. 1c, DSSs solidify into fully ferrite from the liquid at first, and austenite nucleates from ferrite below the ferritic solvus temperature [16].

These precipitates considerably affect both mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, especially regarding the formation of notorious σ and χ phases. The precipitation tendency  can  be  roughly  evaluated  by  the  cooling  rate  from  800  to 500 ◦ C [18]. Therefore, it is critical to maintain the two-phase ratio as well as to avoid the harmful precipitates at the same time.\nThe microstructure evolution of DSSs depends on chemical compositions  and  manufacturing  processes.  With  regard  to  compositions,  a proper Creq/Nieq is beneficial to stabilize the two-phase ratio; while the refinement and purification contribute greatly to eliminate precipitates. On manufacturing aspects, the cooling rate in the range 1200 -800 ◦ C (t12/8) should be adjusted to generate adequate austenite from the primary ferrite. Moreover, the cooling rate in the range 800 -500 ◦ C (t8/5) should  be  adjusted  as  rapid  as  possible  to  inhibit  the  formation  of harmful precipitates [19 -21]. It seems difficult to achieve such a variant cooling  rate  in  a  specific  process,  causing  a  big  problem  for  the manufacturing and application of DSSs. Nevertheless, a great progress has been made on the development of the material and manufacturing of DSSs.\nThe development of DSSs had started since the 1930s [4 -5,22 -25]. The  first  commercial  DSS  of  25Cr-5Ni  was  developed  in  1929.  The increased content of Cr led to high resistance to intergranular corrosion compared with contemporary austenite stainless steels. The addition of Mo  increased  the  resistance  to  pitting  corrosion.  25Cr-5Ni-1Mo  was developed later in 1933. 20Cr-8Ni-2.5Mo exhibited high strength and corrosion resistance in a variety of corrosive media. With the addition of Cu in 1935, 25Cr-5Ni-2.5Mo-2.5Cu further improved the stabilization of austenite phase. The above first generation DSSs were invented with purposes  of  high  corrosion  resistance  as  well  as  the  reduction  of  Ni content in general. However, the weldability of the first generation DSSs was poor. Since 1970s, with the development of refining technologies, the second generation DSSs, represented by 2205 and called as standard DSSs, had substantially suppressed the formation of harmful precipitates by reducing the content of impurities such as C, S and O. Moreover, the addition of strong austenite-stabilizing element N helped to maintain the balance of two phases after welding.",

        "content": "The third generation DSSs, represented by 2507 and called as super DSSs, had been developed since the late 1980s. They had an even lower C content and an even higher amount of austenite stabilizing elements including N and Ni, thus a combined improvement of corrosion resistance and weldability was achieved. The PREN of super DSSs exceeded 40 generally. The unbalanced two-phase ratio as well as the harmful precipitates  had  been  greatly  alleviated  during  the  welding  process. Until now, five typical groups of DSSs have been developed as shown in Table  1  [10].  The  various  types  of  DSSs  can  meet  with  different demanding applications, and play a significant role as key structural materials used in corrosive environment [26 -27]. The weldability of DSSs has been greatly improved. Various welding methods have been attempted to fulfill different requirements. [2,28 -31].\nFig. 1.

        "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as ' 3D printing ' , is a  process  to  make  physical  objects  from  a  three-dimensional  digital model, typically by depositing discrete materials layer-upon-layer [32]. Each layer is in very thin thickness and follows the digitalized pattern. By bonding a series of layers, 3D structures are fabricated efficiently, providing advantages such as free design, less material wastage, and short  lead  time.  By  all  accounts,  AM  is  amazingly  energizing  the manufacturing world. For example, General Electric (GE), an American company,  has  invested  over  1  billion  dollars  on  the  AM  field,  and increasingly gets benefits from the continued investment [33]. Led by the concept of ' Industry 4.0 ' , Europe has achieved a substantial progress for the research and application of AM [34]. So far, the most successful  fields  of  AM  applications  include  aerospace,  medicine,  and personalized consumption products [35 -37].\nGenerally speaking, there are dozens of AM processes developed over the last three decades for different purposes. According to ASTM F279212a, AM processes have been categorized into 7 families [32]. Among them, binder jetting (BJ), direct energy deposition (DED) and powder bed fusion (PBF) are main AM methods for the fabrication of metallic components  [38 -39].  In  BJ  process,  a  liquid  binder  is  dispensed  on powder bed to form structures by adhesion. It is simple and occurs at room temperature. No fusion, oxidation and phase transformation are involved. However, the parts by BJ usually show a low relative density and  poor  mechanical  properties  [40,41].  DED  and  PBF  are  most commonly used metal AM processes in industrial fields. Both of them can provide reliable parts of mechanical properties equivalent to those produced  by  conventional  manufacturing  methods.  In  DED  process, localized heat sources, such as laser (L), electron beam (EB) and electrical  arc  (A),  create  a  moving  molten  pool  accompanied  by  robots. Feedstock materials in forms of powder or wire are deposited into the molten pool layer by layer to form a 3D structure. In PBF process, the powder is spread as a thin layer on the platform in advance, so called a powder  bed.  Highly  focused  heat  sources,  including  laser  beam  and electron beam, selectively melt the powder layer in an inert gas shielded chamber or in a vacuum according to digitalized patterns. Compared to DED, a smaller beam spot, a finer powder size and a powder bed endow PBF with better dimensional accuracy and geometric freedom without rigid support, more suitable for complicated structures. However, the dimensional  size  of  PBF  parts  is  limited  by  the  size  of  processing chamber, and the production time of PBF is longer than that of DED [38,42 -44]. Compared to PBF, DED is more suitable for large structures therefore.\nquality and microstructure evolution.",

        "content": "Three indicators are generally used to evaluate the energy input from heat sources during the DED and PBF [38]. The first one is the energy intensity Ei ( Ei = 4P / π d 2 ). P is the input power and d is the diameter of direct action area of heat sources. A focused heat source with a small d is an efficient way to increase the Ei and to improve the utilization efficiency of energy. Laser beam, electron beam and plasma are typical heat sources with a small d , thus a high Ei . A keyhole is formed due to the recoil force of metal vaporization when the Ei approximately exceeds 10 6 W/cm 2 [53].  A  keyhole  is  generally  observed  during  the  L-PBF process, and doesn't occur in DED laser or DED arc process [38]. The second one is the linear energy input El ( El = P /Vs), which is dependent on input power P and scanning speed Vs. El is widely used to evaluate the heat input during welding processes. The third one is the specific heat input intensity Ev ( Ev = P /(Vs ∙ hs ∙ t l )),  representing  the  heat  input available in unit volume, where hs and t l are hatching space and layer thickness respectively. Ev is widely used to evaluate the heat input of PBF processes. A high energy intensity enables a low heat input to melt the material and to form a certain penetration depth, while a low heat input indicates a high cooling rate, small thermal stress and low distortion.\nFig. 2a shows the typical value of El and the corresponding cooling rate of three major metal AM methods [54]. The El ranks in the order of DED arc > DED laser > L-PBF, and the cooling rate ranks in a reverse order of El . The cooling rate of L-PBF is about 10 4 times that of DED arc. It  should  be  noticed  that  the  cooling  rate  differs  much  according  to measurement  locations  and  temperature  ranges.  The  cooling  rate  in Fig. 2a indicates that measured at the center of the melt pool within the solidification temperature range. Fig. 2b shows the power and scanning speed used in AM of DSSs. The heat input of L-PBF is approximately 10 3 times that of DED arc, and 10 2 times that of DED laser.\nThe study on AM of DSSs has just started in recent years, and is still in its infancy. Currently, wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM, namely DED arc), laser metal deposition (LMD, namely DED laser), and laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF, also referred as selective laser melting SLM) have  been  used  to  fabricate  DSSs,  as  summarized  in  Tables  2 -4 [17,55 -78]. The selection of processing conditions combined with the starting material show substantial influence on the microstructure and properties of DSSs parts produced by AM. Therefore, an investigation on the  influence  of  processing  parameters  on  formation  quality,  microstructure and properties, as well as a comparison among the different AM  processes  and  DSS  materials,  are  needed  to  be  reviewed  and analyzed.",

Pulsed arc, cold metal transfer (CMT) and hot wire are sometimes used to provide more flexibility on the control of heat input and deposition rate [82].

The austenite percentage was higher than that of ferrite. The pitting resistance of the WAAM samples was equivalent to that of wrought alloy. Zhang et al. found that the ferrite content was only 1.55 wt% in the DSS 2594 wall-body produced by WAAM [60]. The formation of nitrides and inclusions led to low impact toughness and low ductility. Hejripour et al. built walls and tubes of DSS 2209,  and  made  a  thermal  analysis  of  the  WAAM  process  by  finite element method (FEM) [58]. The formation of intermetallic phases was prevented because of the high cooling rate. However, the ferrite fraction was much lower than the austenite one. Though the hardness of WAAM parts was lower than that of wrought samples, the tensile strength at the layer direction was comparable to that of the wrought samples.\nThe  as-built  DSS  parts  by  WAAM  usually  exhibit  microstructures with excessive austenite content and harmful secondary phases (nitrides and γ 2) due to the large heat input. The microstructure can be adjusted by processing parameters such as heat input and interlayer temperature. Knezovi ´ c et al. investigated the influence of interlayer temperature on the microstructure and properties of DSS 2205 [55]. With decreasing the interlayer  temperature,  both  the  porosity  and  ferrite  content  rose. Hosseini et al. studied the relationship between thermal cycles and the microstructure [57]. The austenite fraction of as deposited DSS 2209 beads was 46% for LHLT (low heat input and low interlayer temperature) and 38% for HTHH (high heat input and high interlayer temperature). The fraction of secondary phases (nitrides, σ , χ ) was higher in HHHT sample because of the slow cooling rate. The high heat input not only resulted to more harmful secondary phases, but also reduced the dimensional accuracy of DSSs due to thermal distortion.\nIn order to increase the dimensional accuracy of DSS walls, Posch et al. took use of CMT as the heat sources of WAAM to manufacture DSS 2209, which greatly reduced the heat input [56]. The as-built surface roughness was comparable to that produced by sand casting. No porosity\nor lack of fusion, but non-metallic inclusions were found in the samples. The ferritic content was 26 -29%. The tensile strength and toughness were equivalent to those of filler metals. Wittig et al. investigated the influence of arc energy on the microstructure of DSS parts produced by CMT-WAAM  [84].  The  ferrite  content tended to decrease with increasing arc energy, as shown in Fig. 4a. Eriksson et al. investigated the microstructure of DSS 2760 built by CMT-WAAM using different heat input [63]. The ferrite content ranged from 15% to 27%, and varied according to different heat inputs and positions, as shown in Fig. 4b. The tensile strength decreased with increasing the heat input.",

        "content": "As Fig. 5 shows, LMD typically relies upon the feeding of powder or wire into the molten pool created by a laser beam to deposit material layer-by-layer upon a substrate. A shielding gas is used to protect the molten metal from oxidation and to carry the powder stream into the molten pool [69,77,85]. The process is quite like laser cladding except the need to precisely control the robot movement in three-dimensional space.  The  key  processing  parameters  include  laser  power P ,  spot diameter d L, wire or powder feed rate Vf and welding speed Vs. A relatively  big  melt  pool  is  necessary  to  hold  the  filler  materials.  The dL normally takes several millimeters. High powder diode laser provides beam spots of adjustable sizes and uniform energy distribution, and is increasingly used for LMD [86].\nThe laser directly melts the irradiation area, and conducts heat to the substrate  and  filler  material.  The  advantages  of  filler  wire  include commercial availability, low price, nearly 100% utilization ratio, and freedom of position or gravity. However, the absorptivity of laser energy on solid wire is quite low, and the stability of wire transfer during LMD is not as good as that of WAAM. A high laser energy input and a large melt pool increase the processing stability, but result in rough surface finish and extensive machining allowance. The use of powder increases the dimensional accuracy and material flexibility by mixing different powders, but sacrifices the deposition rate and the utilization ratio of materials. Nonetheless, the dimension accuracy is better when fine powder is used. The heat input of LMD falls in between the L-PBF and WAAM as shown in Fig. 2 [38,54]. The deposition rate, dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties of LMD also lie in between. The melt pool needs solid substrate or deposited metal as the support, and it is difficult to build  complicated  parts  with  delicate  overhang  structures.  However, LMD is much suitable for coating or repairing damaged parts [87 -88]. As WAAM and LMD can be operated in open air with local shielding gas, they can build parts of big sizes [89].\nDSS parts have been fabricated by LMD as shown in Table 3. Iams\net  al.  investigated  the  microstructure  produced  by  LMD  using  lean, standard and super DSS powders [78]. The austenite percentage was 16.1%, 38.5%, and 58.3% respectively, and a small amount of σ phase was found in DSS LMD parts. Bermejo et al. utilized N2 as the shielding gas to increase the nitrogen content during the LMD of DSS 2209. The austenite percentage increased to 53 -67% by N2  from 33 -39% by Ar [69].  Wen  et  al.  used  customized  intensive-dual-phase  (IDP)  alloy powder with relatively high Ni content to maintain the austenite content after the LMD [77]. The proportions of austenite and ferrite were about 47% and 37%, respectively. Fe3Ni2 and nitrides were observed in cladding  layers.  The  hardness  of  the  cladding  layers  was  increased  by approximately  15%  compared  with  that  of  the  2205  substrate.  The tensile strength was higher and the corrosion resistance was lower than that of the substrate. The research on the LMD of DSSs is still in its infancy, and more investigations are expected, especially on the microstructure and corrosion resistance.",

Fusion occurs by a raster motion of the focused laser beam controlled by galvanometer driven mirrors [38,91]. Key processing parameters include laser power P , spot diameter dL , scanning speed Vs, layer thickness Ds and hatching space Hs . The dL is roughly in the range of 30 -100 μ m, much smaller than that of LMD. Considering a laser power over 100 W, the highly focused laser beam  provides  energy  intensity Ei exceeding  10 6 W/cm 2 ,  which  is generally much higher than that of LMD. Compared to WAAM and LMD, the heat input is the lowest, the temperature gradient is the highest, and the cooling rate is the fastest for L-PBF.\nThe stable spreading of powder into uniform thin layers is significant to the L-PBF process. General requirements for L-PBF powder include spherical shape, uniform size distribution, high density without defects such  as  pores  and  inclusions,  etc.  [38,42,44,92].  The  mean  size  of powder and the layer thickness usually range 20 -50 μ m, much finer than those used in LMD. The L-PBF powder is usually produced by gas atomization (GA) and plasma rotating electrode process (PREP) to ensure powder quality [93 -95]. The strict requirement of the powder increases material  cost,  but  the  combined  utilization  of  a  highly  focused  laser beam and a fine powder bed endows L-PBF huge advantages such as geometric freedom without rigid support, high dimensional accuracy, high performance, and so on [38,96 -100].

The relative density of components varied according to laser energy input as shown in Fig. 7a. Defects including lack of fusion and porosity were observed inside the L-PBF samples. The average ferrite percentage was 68.8% and the ferritic grain grew along the building direction. The precipitation of CrN was observed due to the high cooling rate. The maximum hardness was 449.4 HV, higher than that of the wrought substrate. With enhancing the laser energy input, the austenite percentage rose up, and the hardness fell down. The layer- upon-layer  melting  resulted  to  heterogeneous  distribution  of  microstructure and hardness. Murkute et al. deposited DSS 2507 on the substrate of low carbon steel by using L-PBF [73]. With decreasing scanning speed,  the  Cr  content  dropped  in  the  deposited  layers  due  to  the increased evaporation loss, and the austenite percentage increased. It was reported that the increased scanning speed had a negative effect on the  surface  roughness  and  corrosion  resistance.  The  deposited  layer showed comparable corrosion resistance to the rolled and annealed DSS sample when the scanning speed was 100 mm/s.\nNigon et al. investigated the influence of processing parameters on the formation quality of DSS 2205 [67].

The tensile strength, yield strength and hardness of DSS 2507 were 1321 MPa, 1214 MPa and 450 HV respectively, superior to those of counterpart samples.

The tensile strength of the as-built samples was higher than that of the wrought samples, which was explained by refined grains and high dislocation density. The elongation at fracture increased from 12 to 28% after the heat treatment. Shang et al. investigated the influence of solution treatment on the L-PBF of super DSS 2707 [75].

        "content": "Lack of fusion and porosity are common defects during the AM of DSSs that need to be minimized due to their adverse effects on properties, which are usually evaluated by the relative density. The lack of fusion indicates irregular voids between scan tracks and layers as shown in Fig. 8a, and is caused by incomplete fusion due to insufficient heat input [38]. This defect can be eliminated by increasing Ev accordingly [104]. There are two major mechanisms for porosity during the AM: metallurgical pores and keyhole pores [103,106]. For WAAM and LMD, the porosity is resulted by metallurgical pores, which mainly refer to those resulted by the solution difference of gas between solid and liquid. The entrapped gas can come from the surrounding atmosphere, filler wires or powder particles. The filler materials must be dense and clean, and properly kept before the use in order to eliminate the gas sources. In addition, gas pores may also be formed due to the entrapment of the shielding gas or air due to poor shielding effect. Regarding L-PBF, the melt pool is fully protected in a closed chamber, and thus there is little concern on metallurgical pores resulted by the inclusion of surrounding air. The metallurgical pores in L-PBF mainly come from powder particles or shielding gas. The entrapped gas results in microscopic spherical gas pores, as shown in Fig. 8a and b [55,104].\nKeyhole model melting occurs in most L-PBF processes considering the applied energy intensity. The keyhole constantly vibrates under the dynamic balance of momentum according to the in-situ X-ray observation [101 -103]. The keyhole can be seriously unstable with inadequate energy input. It repeatedly generates and collapses, leaving blowholes inside  the  deposited  metal  that  consist  of  entrapped  metal  vapor  or shielding gas. The size of keyhole pores can vary depending on the shape and size of the keyhole. The keyhole pores contribute to the majority of porosity  during  the  L-PBF  and  are  directly  related  to  energy  input. Therefore, a general law exists regarding the processing optimization as shown in Fig. 8c. Too small energy input Ev results in the lack of fusion; too big Ev causes the keyhole porosity; only an adequate Ev is able to obtain high densification. Due to the nature of keyhole, it is regarded almost impossible to eliminate all keyhole pores in the L-PBF parts [67]. The tiny pores have little influence on tensile strength, but damage fatigue strength largely. If the pores occur at the surface, they naturally become the initiation locations of pit corrosion, deteriorating corrosion resistance. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) has been applied to increase the densification, thus improving the performance of DSSs parts produced by AM as shown in Fig. 8d [66].\nFig. 8. Densification of AM DSSs: (a) pore morphology of L-PBF DSS 2507 with different energy densities [104], (b) X-ray inspection pictures of the WAAM DSS 2205 with different interlayer temperatures [55], (c) parametric optimization of L-PBF DSS 2205 [67], (d) pore size distribution of DSS 2205 and 2507 produced by LPBF [66].",

The  surface  quality  of  WAAM  and  LMD  parts  are  not acceptable for final parts, thus post machining is generally necessary. Dimensional allowance must be considered in the AM designing and manufacturing period. The SR of L-PBF parts is relatively small, ranging dozens of micrometers. Instead of machining, sandblasting and etching are usually used to improve the surface quality if necessary [42,79 -80]. Processing conditions also have an influence on the SR. As shown in Fig. 9a, the SR of L-PBF parts decreases with increasing Ev [67]. High densification  usually  indicates  good  surface  quality  and  vice  versa. Excessive  energy  input  increases  the  temperature  of  the  melt  pool, which contributes to spatter and deteriorates surface quality. Fig. 9b exhibits  that  the  SR  increases  with  increasing  scan  speed.  It  can  be explained by balling effect, caused by melt splash and high scanning speed [38,73,109]. Therefore, it concludes that a relatively high energy input with a low scanning speed is beneficial to improve surface quality regarding the AM of DSSs.",

The distribution of elements of DSSs has an important impact on the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.  Zhang  et  al.  reported  the  element  partitioning  during  the WAAM of DSS 2594 as shown in Fig. 11 [112]. Compared with the filler wire, heterogeneous distribution of elements including Cr, Ni, Mo in the two  phases  was  observed  in  the  as-built  parts.  In  the  top  layer,  the austenite phase had a higher content of Cr and Mo, and a lower content of Ni compared with those in root and wall regions. The composition in liquid is homogeneous. During the solidification process in WAAM, the diffusion of alloying elements was impeded due to the rapid cooling rate. Because of the reheating by the deposition of successive layers in root and wall regions, Cr and Mo were preferred to concentrate in ferrite, and Ni showed a higher content in austenite.\nIn the LMD process, the austenite and ferrite of as-built DSSs showed almost identical content of alloying elements, as reported by Iams et al. [78]. The rapid cooling rate suppressed the diffusion of elements, which was also reported in laser welding of DSSs [113]. After the HIP, the distribution of alloying elements changed.

The different evaporation loss of various elements leads to composition change between the starting material and the final part, thus directly affecting the microstructure and properties [69,73].\nAs Fig. 12a shows, the Cr content decreases from 25.2 to 12.2 wt% with the reduction of scan speed from 1000 to 100 mm/s during the LPBF of DSS 2507 [73]. Bermejo et al. studied the loss of N content during the LMD of DSS 2209 when Ar was used as the shielding gas. As shown in Fig. 12b, the N content in the as-built parts was 0.1 -0.14 wt%, lower than 0.16 wt% of the starting powder [69]. The increase of heat input increased the loss of N element. Fig. 12c shows the mechanism of N loss in the welding process of DSSs. It mainly occurs due to the difference of the  N  concentration  between  the molten  pool and the shielding gas. When the concentration gradient from the melt pool to the shielding gas is negative, the N element escapes from the melt pool to the atmosphere. Moreover, the loss of N element is also resulted from the metal vapor. For  L-PBF,  the  existence  of  the  keyhole  considerably  increases  the evaporation loss of element [114]. As it illustrated in Fig. 12d, the weld beads are surrounded by other beads and the base metal. The contact between the melt pool and the shielding gas is limited, thus resulting in the  lower  N  loss  than  AM  processes  [57].  In  order  to  effectively compensate the evaporation loss of N, the shielding gas containing N2 can be used. As shown in Fig. 12b, a considerable increase of N has been achieved in the DSS parts by changing the shielding gas from Ar to N2 [69].",

The cooling rate decreases  and  the  grain  size  increases  with  elevating  the  heat  input [76 -77,112].  As  reported  by  Murkute  et  al.,  the  average  grain  size decreased from 108 to 19 μ m 2 when the scan speed was increased from 100 to 1000 mm/s during the L-PBF of DSS 2507 [73].\nSince the ferrite phase forms directly from the solidification, its grain morphology is determined by G/R, namely the temperature gradient (G) divided  by  the  solidification  rate  (R)  at  the  solidification  front. Columnar grains occur with a large G/R and equiaxed grains occur with a small G/R [54,96]. The G/R ranks in the order of L-PBF > LMD > WAAM. The primary ferrite in DSS parts generally shows columnar for LPBF, equiaxed for WAAM and columnar or mixed for LMD. The ferrite transforms  to  austenite  following  the  solidification  by  solid  transformation.  The  austenite  can  exhibit  four  different  morphologies  according to AM processing conditions and DSS materials: intragranular austenite  (IGA),  grain  boundary  austenite  (GBA),  Widmanst ¨ atten austenite (WA) and secondary austenite ( γ 2), as shown in Fig. 13 [112]. During the cooling period, the transformation from ferrite to GBA occurs at  first  in  the  temperature  range  of  1350 -800 ◦ C.  WA nucleates and grows from GBA with further decreasing temperature. WA usually shows lath-shaped morphology. IGA precipitates in the ferrite matrix if sufficient time is provided at elevated temperature. The precipitation of IGA is limited due to high activation energy of lattice diffusion [78,117 -118]. The precipitation of secondary austenite is mainly caused by the reheating process from the deposition of successive layers, and will be discussed in detail in Section 3.3.2.",

For  WAAM  parts,  the  columnar  ferrite  exhibits  a strong [001] texture in the deposition direction, while austenite presents [001, 101] orientations, as shown in Fig. 15 [112]. The columnar grains with a certain orientation lead to anisotropic properties [119]. Zhang et al. found the anisotropy of tensile properties in DSS 2594 samples. The tensile strength at the horizontal direction (HD) was higher than that at the BD [60]. Nigon et al. reported anisotropic corrosion resistance of DSS 2205 samples produced by L-PBF. The corrosion current of sample surface vertical to BD was 83.2 nA/cm 2 , higher than 65.4 nA/ cm 2 of  surface  parallel  to  BD,  which  was  explained  by  the  oriented grains and the resulting different grain boundaries at the exposed areas [68].

        "content": "3.3.2.1. Two-phase ratio. The two-phase ratio depends on two factors: chemical compositions and AM processing conditions. A high Creq/Nieq and a small t12/8 increase the ferrite percentage, while a low Creq/Nieq and  a  big  t12/8  promote  the  formation  of  austenite.  During  welding processes, a larger heat input results to a bigger t12/8 and more austenite. Generally, the rapid cooling rate at the heat affect zone (HAZ) causes excessive ferrite, especially for laser welding with a relatively small heat input. Super DSS with a low Creq/Nieq has been developed to inhibit the formation of ferrite and improve the weldability [29,120]. For the AM of DSSs,  a  similar  pattern  has  been  observed.  Compared  with  welding, multiple repeated heating is performed in AM processes. For WAAM, the accumulated heat input is greater than that of arc welding. The cooling rate of t12/8 is much lower, therefore excessive austenite is usually found in DSS parts produced by WAAM. However, excessive ferrite is usually found in the DSS parts produced by LMD and L-PBF due to the small heat input. Austenite phases can be hardly observed in some DSS parts produced by L-PBF. The austenite percentage of DSS 2205 samples fabricated  by  L-PBF,  LMD  and  WAAM  was  1%  [64],  38.5%  [78]  and 61.5 -66.1% [55] respectively, although the original austenite percentage of the starting feedstocks was all kept as 50%.\nFig. 12.

Super DSS 2507 had the lowest value of Creq/Nieq, which positively contributed to the increased content of austenite [78]. Wen et al. used customized DSS powder which had a higher Ni content than that of DSS 2205, and obtained DSS parts with the austenite percentage of 47% by LMD [77]. For\nFig. 14.

Stützer et al. fed a second customized wire of 2253 to the melt pool during the WAAM of DSS 2293. By adjusting the feeding ratios of the two wires and the heat input, DSS parts of thin walls were deposited with different values of Creq/Nieq. The two wires were homogeneously mixed and the ferrite contents in the specimens varied in the range of 39 -72% [121]. In addition to the feedstock materials, the evaporation loss and the use of different shielding atmosphere also influence the two-phase ratio. When Ar gas is used, the evaporation loss causes a reduction of N element. The use of N2 as the shielding gas can increase  the  content  of  N  in  the  DSS  parts.  It  was  reported  that  the austenite content was nearly doubled during the LMD of DSS 2205: from\n39% when Ar-shielded to 67% when N2-shielded [69].\nKnezovi ´ c et al. increased the ferrite content from 33.9 to 38.5% by decreasing  the  interlayer  temperature  from  150  to  50 ◦ C  during  the WAAM  of  DSS  2205.  The  transformation  from  ferrite  to  austenite required  time  for  diffusion.  Wall  produced  using  the  interlayer  temperature of 150 ◦ C was made for more than twice less time than the one with 50 ◦ C while having about 5% lower ferrite amount [55]. Murkute et al. found that the austenite content increased from 1.1 to 10.7% with decreasing scanning speed from 1000 to 100 mm/s during the L-PBF of DSS 2507. A low scan speed provided more time for the phase transformation  from  ferrite  to  austenite  [73].  The  austenite  content  was respectively 51.78, 98.45 and 84.77 wt% in the top layer, wall-body and root  region  during  the  WAAM  of  DSS  2594,  caused  by  the  different thermal cycles in different layers [60]. The bottom layers on the substrate  had  the  highest  cooling  rate,  leading  to  the  lowest  content  of austenite. The middle layers had a much slower cooling rate due to the heat accumulation [122]. At the same time, the subsequently depositing layers provided heat treatment to the previously deposited layers, and contributed  to  an  increase  of  austenite  content  in  the  previously deposited layers. The top layer had a lower austenite proportion since it was not further reheated [58,63]. The difference of the phase ratio of different layers led to the inhomogeneous properties of DSSs. As shown in Fig. 16, the microhardness of WAAM DSSs 2954 varied with different positions of the wall [60].",

The phases presented in the as-built 22Cr and 25Cr DSS parts were quantified as nearly 100% ferrite. After the solution treatment, the austenite to ferrite ratio restored to 45:55 for 22Cr and 52:48 for 25Cr. The peak temperature was set at 1100 and 1170 ◦ C respectively for  22Cr and 25Cr.  The  holding  times  were  both  set  as  5  min  followed  by  water quenching [17].

In addition to the matrix phases of austenite and ferrite, secondary phases may also occur according to the applied thermal cycles during the AM processes as shown in Fig. 1c, such as intermetallic compounds ( σ and χ ), nitrides (CrN and Cr2N), secondary austenite ( γ 2), carbides [16,123 -124]. The formation of σ phase mostly originates from the eutectoid transformation of ferrite ( δ → σ + γ 2), and occurs at the temperature range of 600 to 1000 ◦ C. The brittle σ phase enriches  in  Fe,  Cr  and  Mo,  and  usually  precipitates  at δ / γ phase boundaries or triple junctions. A short t8/5, namely a rapid cooling rate, inhibits the formation of σ phase [29]. The formation of σ phase has been scarcely observed during the LMD and L-PBF processes due to the rapid cooling  rate  as  shown  in  Tables  2 -4.  Gas  tungsten  arc  melting  was applied to DSS 2507 samples in order to physically simulate the influence of WAAM thermal cycles, so called a duplicated additively manufactured structure (DAMS) [125]. As shown in Fig. 18, nitrides and σ phase  were  observed  in  the  high  and  low  temperature  heat  affected zones respectively. The presence of σ phase decreased the toughness and ductility, but increased the tensile strength of DSSs [126]. As for the influence on corrosion behavior, Moura et al. reported that the pitting potential of DSS 2205 significantly decreased from 1.03 to 0.42 VSCE at room temperature with the increase of σ phase from 4.7 to 28.1% [127]. Martins et al. found that the σ phase disappeared by solution annealing at temperature above 1060 ◦ C followed by quenching [128]. The effect of sigma phase morphology on the degradation of properties in a super DSS was also reported [129].\nThe addition of nitrogen in DSS promotes the formation of austenite, but  it  also  increases  the  tendency  of  nitride  precipitation.  Nitrogen atoms are designed to be uniformly dissolved in ferrite and austenite phases for DSS materials. The solubility and diffusion rate of nitrogen are different in the two phases, leading to the supersaturated N in the ferrite  [14,114 -115]. Nitrides precipitate  from the  ferrite  due  to  the rapid cooling rate, since there is insufficient time for nitrogen to diffuse into the austenite [130]. The formation of nitrides also relates to the absence  of  adequate  austenite  content,  since  there  is  not  enough austenite to dissolve the nitrogen. Davidson et al. observed spherical and acicular  CrN  phases  during  the  L-PBF  of  DSS  2507  as  shown  in Fig.  19a -b  [71].  Hengsbach  et  al.  observed  the  precipitation  of\nFig. 18.

By increasing the austenite percentage with the use of N2 shielding gas or solution heat treatment, more nitrogen is dissolved in the matrix, which inhibits the precipitation of nitrides [133 -134].\nThe  repeated  heating  of  previous  layers  can  lead  to  the  transformation from ferrite into γ 2 phase. Lervåg et al. observed γ 2 during the\nWAAM of DSS 2507, as shown in Fig. 20a -b.

The  hardness  of austenite and ferrite increases with increasing their dissolved alloying elements [137 -138]. The diffusion of alloying elements depends on the temperature and cooling rate, resulting in the redistribution of chemical compositions, microstructure and hardness. The hardness changes with the two-phase ratio. In addition, the precipitation of secondary brittle phases generally increases the hardness. Take DSS 2205 as an example, the average hardness was 419, 284 and 245 HV for the as-built samples of L-PBF [67], LMD [78] and WAAM [55] respectively. For the comparison,  the  hardness  of  wrought  DSS  2205  was  267  HV  [67].  The hardness is also influenced by the grain size. The finest grain size during the L-PBF partly explains the difference of hardness among various AM processing conditions. The rapid cooling rate promotes the formation of nitrides  during  the  L-PBF,  which  significantly  increases  the  hardness [71]. The heat treatment largely influences the distribution of alloying elements, the two-phase ratio and the secondary phases, thus has a huge effect on the hardness of samples produced by various AM processes [65,78].",

The grain size of DSSs can be much finer than that of ASSs, which explains the higher strength and ductility of DSSs to a great extent. The increase of alloying elements may also increase the strength due to solution strengthening effect [140 -141]. With increasing the ferrite percentage, the strength increases, but the ductility  and  toughness decreases.  The  FCC  structure  of  austenite  can  tolerate  more  plastic deformation, and improves the ductility of DSSs [142 -143]. According to Tables 2 -4, DSSs samples made by L-PBF have the highest tensile strength,  over  900  MPa, but  the lowest  elongation, normally around 10%, which is attributed to fine grains, excessive ferrite phase, nitride precipitation and high dislocation density [70,144]. Compared with LPBF,  the  DSSs  made  by  WAAM  have  a  lower  strength  but  a  higher elongation, mainly attributed to the bigger grain size and higher proportion of austenite caused by the larger heat input.

The lower fatigue strength was explained by the high surface roughness resulted by the attachment of powder particles, the formation of porosity defect and the anisotropic microstructure. Moreover, austenite phase had higher plastic deformation capacity than ferrite, which absorbed the energy and reduced the notch sensitivity. The L-PBF samples had a fully ferritic microstructure, thus leading\nFig. 20. Secondary austenite in WAAM: (a -b) DSS 25Cr [62], (c -d) DSS 2594 [60].\nto  high  notch  sensitivity  resistance.

HIP further improved the fatigue strength to 470 MPa due to the significant reduction of the porosity.",

        "content": "The impact toughness of ferrite phase can drop suddenly at certain low  temperature,  so  called  the  ductile-brittle  transition  temperature (DBTT). The impact toughness is evaluated by the absorbed energy and the  DBTT for ferrite  steels.  The  impact  toughness  of  austenite  phase doesn't show obvious change with varying temperature. ASSs usually have  excellent  impact  toughness  even  at  very  low  temperature.  The impact  toughness  of  DSS  falls  in  between  ferrite  steels  and  ASSs [146 -148].  The  proportion  of  austenite  positively  contributes  to  the toughness of DSSs. With increasing the austenite percentage of DSSs, the toughness increases and vice versa [60,70]. The precipitation of secondary phases deteriorates the toughness to a great extent, especially the σ phase [149]. Shang et al. reported the tensile properties and impact toughness of DSS 2707 samples built by L-PBF. According to Charpy Vnotched impact test, the absorbed energy of rectangular as built samples with the size of 55 × 10 × 10 mm was only 18 J at room temperature. The as-built samples had 0.2% austenite only. After solution treatment at 1050 ◦ C, the austenite percentage increased to 88.4%. Meanwhile, the σ phase was observed and took up 10% in volume. The impact toughness further  dropped.  After  solution  treatment  at  1150 ◦ C,  the  ferrite  to austenite  ratio  recovered  to  61.4:38.6,  and  no  secondary  phase  was observed. The toughness increased to 132 J [75].\nThe  absorbed  energy  of  DSS  2209  as-built  samples  produced  by WAAM-CMT was 77 J, comparable to 70 J of the filler metal according to the Charpy V-notched test. The austenite percentage was approximately 70%, and no secondary phase was observed. Additionally, the measured oxygen content was low, which also contributed to the high toughness [56]. The absorbed energy of super DSS 2594 was around 100 J for the as-built WAAM samples, approximately 30 -35% of that of DSS 2507 base metal. The decreased toughness was attributed to the coarse grain and the formation of defects in the WAAM samples. A slight reduction of toughness was observed with increasing the heat input from 0.4 to 0.87 kJ/mm [62 -63]. There have been no reports on the impact toughness of DSSs made by LMD. Nevertheless, no report has been found on  the  fracture  toughness  for  the  DSSs  made  by  the  mentioned  AM processes.",

        "content": "The corrosion resistance of DSSs is generally equivalent or superior to that of ASSs, and is a critical concern for the application of AM of DSSs. Corrosion is a complicated physical and chemical process, and can be categorized into uniform corrosion, intergranular corrosion, pitting corrosion,  crevice  corrosion,  stress  corrosion  cracking  and  so  on [150 -151]. The pitting corrosion has been observed most commonly for the DSSs and the pits can be the sources of stress corrosion cracking and fatigue corrosion. The influence of chemical compositions on the pitting corrosion resistance can be evaluated by the value of PREN as shown in Eq. (1). The pitting corrosion resistance decreased with decreasing the content of Cr, Mo and N [152]. During AM processes, the evaporation loss of alloying elements led to the deterioration of corrosion resistance [69,73]. Nevertheless, the redistribution of alloying elements during the AM processes also played an important role on the corrosion resistance [112,153]. In terms of formation quality, surface defects acted as the initiation  points  of  pitting  corrosion,  and  decreased  the  corrosion resistance of DSS [73,154].\nGenerally speaking, corrosion resistance decreases with decreasing the  grain  size  for  DSSs.  Fine  grain  size  increases  the  area  of  grain boundaries  of  high  energy,  which  speeds  up  the  corrosion  [155].\nHowever, there are also some reports exhibiting the opposite conclusion. Ma et al. reported that grain refinement caused by friction stir welding decreased the corrosion current from 8.26 × 10 GLYPH<0> 7 to 2.72 × 10 GLYPH<0> 7 A/cm 2 for DSSs 2507 [156]. It was explained by the enhancement of passive films due to the enlarged area of grain boundaries. The texture on the surface has an effect on the composition of passive film, thus affecting the corrosion behavior of DSSs. The passive film with 〈 001 〉 //X texture was found porous and less protective with more NiO and less Cr2O3. The passive film with 〈 111 〉 //X texture was less porous with more Cr oxides, thus leading to the higher corrosion resistance [59].\nThe effect of two-phase ratio on corrosion resistance mainly depends on the content of alloying elements dissolved in the phases [6,9,19 -20]. During the early development stage of DSSs, it was regarded that the corrosion resistance of DSSs dropped down if the content of alloying elements in the two phases was different, since the two phases might generate  galvanic  current  in  corrosive  medium  because  of  potential difference. Considering that it was difficult to maintain the equivalent content of alloying elements in two phases during the manufacturing and service, to a certain extent it had become a great concern for the application of DSSs. However, the recent development has shown that the corrosion resistance of DSSs is acceptable even if the two-phase ratio deviates from the ideal 1:1 or the alloying elements are not uniformly distributed [17,68]. The latest findings provide more confidence for the application of DSSs.",

        "content": "The precipitation of secondary phases, especially the σ phase, greatly deteriorates  the  corrosion  resistance,  as  discussed  in  Section  3.3.2. Kannan et al. investigated the corrosion behavior of super DSS 2594 walls produced by WAAM. The corrosion rate ranged between 1.54 and 1.61  mpy  and  pitting  resistance  was  excellent  compared  to  wrought alloy  with  stable  micro-level  pits.  The  PREN  was > 40  and  this  was attributed to the increased wt% of Cr and Mo in the wall component. The double-loop electrochemical potentiodynamic reactivation (DLEPR) test revealed no sensitization, which was due to the absence of detrimental phases and comparable microstructure [61]. Zhang et al. investigated the effect of heat treatment on the corrosion resistance of DSS 2209 produced  by  WAAM.  The  pitting  corrosion  resistance  was  improved after heat-treatment at 1300 ◦ C, and was comparable to that of the DSS 2205 rolled samples. The good pitting corrosion resistance was the integrated result of the balanced phase ratio, the absence of secondary phases,  the 〈 111 〉 //X  texture  of  austenite,  the  low  crystalline  defect density and the recrystallization of austenite [59].\nThe large heat input of WAAM promotes the formation of excessive austenite and secondary phases due to slow cooling rate, and results to relatively coarse grains. While the small heat input of L-PBF promotes the formation of excessive ferrite and nitride due to rapid cooling rate, and results to relatively fine columnar grains with prominent texture. Nigon  et  al.  investigated  the  effect  of  building  orientation  and  heat treatment on corrosion resistance of DSS 2205 made by L-PBF. No stable pit formation occurred; metastable pitting was observed on all samples except the as-built parallel ones. The cause of the metastable pitting was likely attributed to the residual porosity and/or chemical inhomogeneity.  Despite  clear  textural  and  microstructural  differences among the samples at different building orientations and heat treatment, the measured pitting corrosion resistance was similar for all the L-PBF samples, and comparable to that of DSS 2205 wrought samples. It suggested that the bulk chemical composition was the governing factor for pitting  corrosion  resistance  [68].  Papula  et  al.  found  that  the  coldrolled/solution-treated samples and the L-PBF as-built samples of DSS 2205 showed a lower passive current density than the solution-treated LPBF samples. The high corrosion resistance of L-PBF samples may be related to the fine grain size and the non-existence of harmful secondary phases [65].\nExcept standard DSS 2205, the corrosion resistance of super DSSs by L-PBF is widely reported. Murkute et al. found that the increasing scan speeds from 100 to 1000 mm/s resulted in decreasing corrosion resistance of the deposited super DSS 2507 layers. The low scan speed clads\nGLYPH<0>3GLYPH<0>U\n(Vs = 100 mm/s) showed a comparable corrosion resistance to the rolled and  annealed  super  DSS  [73].  The  solution-treated  samples  showed significantly lower corrosion rates than as-built samples. The residual tensile stress resulted in a high corrosion rate for as-built samples. Heat treatment eliminated the residual stress, and restored corrosion resistance  [74].  Shang  et  al.  found  that  the  proper  solution  treatment increased  the  austenite  percentage  from  0.2%  to  40.5%,  and  greatly improved pitting corrosion resistance [75].",

The as-built M7-3 had a significantly  improved pitting  corrosion  resistance  compared  to  AISI  316L. [157].\nThere have been fewer reports so far on the corrosion resistance of DSS sample produced by LMD compared to WAAM and L-PBF. Wen et al. deposited layers on the DSS 2205 substrate with customized DSS powders. The corrosion resistance of deposited layers was slightly lower than that of DSS 2205 substrate, which was explained by the two-phase ratio and chromium nitrides [77]. Wang et al. deposited DSS layers on low alloy steels by LMD with a commercial powder named KF-JG-3. The corrosion resistance was much better than that of the substrate, confirming  that  the  LMD  of  DSSs  can  be  a  promising  candidate  for  the protective coating of low alloy steels [158].",

In any case, the adequate heat input is necessary to achieve good formation quality for all the three AM processes. Compared with the use of powder as feedstock, feeding wire shows merits such as a higher deposition rate, a lower cost and few limitations by gravity, but weakness such as the low dimensional accuracy and the requirement to a large heat input. Compared with conduction mode melting in the WAAM and LMD, keyhole mode melting occurs in the L-PBF. The keyhole porosity is much sensitive to the heat input. The densification behavior can be improved by the optimization of processing parameters however. HIP can also be used to eliminate internal defects in DSS parts. Compared with the relatively good finish in the L-PBF, the surface quality of WAAM and LMD are not acceptable for final  parts,  thus  post  machining  is  generally  necessary.  High  cooling rates in AM process suppress the partitioning of alloying elements between austenite and ferrite phases. The loss of elements, such as Cr and N, occurs in AM process. The use of N2 as the shielding gas compensates the evaporation loss of N. Post solution heat treatment releases the residual stress and modulates the microstructure.",

Super DSSs help to maintain the content of austenite during the LMD and L-PBF processes in which rapid cooling rates are used. The slow cooling  rate  during  the  WAAM  probably  results  to  the  formation  of excessive austenite, decreasing the strength to a certain extent. On the contrary, L-PBF DSSs have a microstructure with predominant ferrite grains  due  to  the  extremely  high  cooling  rate,  resulting  in  the  low ductility and toughness. Secondary phases, nitrides, secondary austenite and sigma, can be observed in the microstructure of AM DSSs especially with a large heat input, greatly influencing mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of materials.

The high cooling rate during L-PBF results to refined grains with the size of 1 -10 μ m, much smaller than those obtained by LMD and WAAM, leading to the higher hardness and strength.
