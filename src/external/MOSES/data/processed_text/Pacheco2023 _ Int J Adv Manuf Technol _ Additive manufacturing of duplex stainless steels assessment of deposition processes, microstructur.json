        "content": "One of the main highlights of additive manufacturing (AM) processes is the ability of building components of different sizes and geometries from the build-up of deposition of layers up on layers. However, the deposition heat cycle and amount of heat coming from successively deposited layers poses a challenge on the control of microstructure, particularly for alloys with a complex metallurgy, such as duplex stainless steels (DSSs). Due to successive cycles of rapid cooling and reheating of previously deposited layers, obtaining the ferrite and austenite phases in the adequate proportion needs to be addressed for each process and processing conditions. This manuscript addresses this metallurgical challenge aiming at reviewing the main features of DSSs processed by AM processes, particularly directed energy deposition (DED) processes. The discussion brings the main points that have been investigated on AM of DSSs, including the impact of thermal cycles (effect of heat input or energy density and reheated layers) and post processing heat treatment (PPHT) on the multilayer microstructure. Results obtained by plasma transferred arc directed energy deposition (PTA-DED) and laser directed energy deposition (L-DED) additive processes, electric arc and high energy beam techniques, respectively, are used to illustrate and highlight the response of a gas atomized superduplex stainless steel 2507 to multilayer processing and subsequent PPHT. The relevance of controlling the microstructure on the properties and performance of DSSs processed by AM is also addressed.\nKeywords Additive manufacturing · Duplex stainless steel · Thermal cycles · Microstructure · Properties",

AM technology allows to fabricate components of different geometries and sizes [1], with specific functionalities customized for each application [2, 3]. AM technology can use metals, polymers, and ceramics [4-6]. Among the metallic feedstock available, stainless steels, nickel, cobalt, aluminum, and titanium alloys have been processed with different AM processes.\nStainless steels (austenitic, ferritic, martensitic, duplex, and precipitation hardened) can be highlighted due to their excellent mechanical and corrosive properties, being widely\n* Jeferson T.

Duplex stainless steels (DSSs) comprise a special stainless steel alloy class, containing an approximately equal amount of ferrite (α) and austenite (γ) phases. The combination of these phases provides intermediate mechanical properties between austenitic and ferritic stainless steels [9], and high corrosion resistance.\nDSSs are typically classified into four groups according to their chemical composition and corrosion resistance: lean duplex stainless steel (LDSS), standard stainless steel (SSS), superduplex stainless steel (SDSS), and hyperduplex stainless steel (HDSS) [10], Table 1. Cr content in DSS is present in different ranges, with LDSS exhibiting 20-23%, SSS 22%, SDSS 25%, and HDSS > 25%. The effect of the main chemical elements on DSSs is shown in Table 2.\nAlthough most stainless steels have good processability in AM processes, the large number of thermal cycles of AM is a major challenge for DSSs, as it determines the balance between austenite and ferrite. According to NORSOK M-630 standard, the ideal amount of austenite for DSSs is 35-65% [13], but unlike casting process, achieving this ratio\n\nTable 1 Classification of DSSs according to chemical compositions (wt. %) and PREN (Pitting Resistance Equivalent Number).

In large quantities, precipitation of intermetallic phases can occur, which reduce the ductility, hardness, and corro- sion resistance. Ni, Effect = Austenite stabilizer. In large quantities, it can cause the precipitation of α' phase in ferrite when subjected to temperatures between 650 and 950 °C.

Whenever a 1:1 ratio is not achievable, it is preferable to have more austenite since it tends to increase impact toughness and pitting corrosion resistance [16].\nThermal cycling can affect the phase ratio of ferrite to austenite in DSSs and also the formation of deleterious phases that are harmful to mechanical and corrosion properties. A considerable part of secondary phase transformations occurs in the temperature range between 550 and 1000 °C, Table 3. The most common intermetallic is σ phase (Fe-Cr-Mo), which can be directly related to chemical composition [12]. Other intermetallic constituents are χ (Fe 36 Cr12 Mo10), R (Fe-Cr-Mo) and α' (Fe-Cr), which progressively increase hardness and mechanical strength. Carbides   (M 7 C3/M23C6) and nitrides (CrN/Cr 2 N) might also be present in DSSs [17, 18].\nThe main AM processes used for metallic parts are powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition (DED)\nTable 3 [17, 18], 1 = Compounds in DSSs Phase.

Laser directed energy deposition (L-DED) and laser engineered net shaping (LENS) are laser based processes that use powder or wire as feedstock [19]. Studies assessing DSSs processed by L-DED are frequently\nFig. 1 Schemes representing the most used processes in the deposition of DSSs on AM: a laser directed energy deposition (L-DED), b laser wire directed energy deposition (Lw-DED), c gas metal arc welding (GMAW), d gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), e plasma arc welding (PAW), and f plasma transferred arc directed energy deposition (PTA-DED)\nfound in the literature, but the same does not apply to DSSs processed by the LENS process. WAAM processes can be classified into gas metal arc welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), and plasma arc welding (PAW) [20]. The majority of WAAM use wire feedstock, but plasma transferred arc can also use powder as feedstock [21].\nWhile the laser beam delivers a concentrated amount of heat, the electric arc thermally affects a larger area. L-DED and Lw-DED processes consist of simultaneous deposition and melting of the feedstock material, forming a small melting pool in previously layer [22], Fig. 1 a and b. Lw-DED process requires higher laser power to melt the wire, but it also offers greater efficiency and is intended for manufacturing larger parts than those obtained with a powder feedstock [23].\nAmong the electric arc process, higher energy efficiency and higher deposition rates are achieved in the GMAW processing, where wire is automatically fed and melted by the arc, Fig. 1c. Deposition rate from 3 to 4 kg/h can be obtained [20]. GMAW based on cold metal transfer (CMT) imposes a lower heat build-up and higher efficiency, but surface finish quality is inferior to that of GMAW process [24]. The arc in the GTAW process is struck between a non-consumable tungsten electrode and\nthe substrate, Fig. 1d, while the wire is fed by a separate wire feeder mechanism [25]. A plasma jet is created from the ionization of an inert gas in the PAW process, Fig. 1e, and the arc stabilization occurs between a non-consumable tungsten electrode and the substrate. The plasma is directed onto the substrate through the nozzle and the wire is feed laterally [26]. In PTA-DED process, a close electric circuit involves the part being processed, the powder is feed coaxially through the nozzle, Fig. 1f, and dilution is typically lower than in PAW process [27-29].\nThe differences between heat sources induce different features in the deposited material as the wide range of values of energy density (ED) [kJ/mm], Eq. 1, or heat input (HI) [kJ/mm], Eq. 2, L-DED and WAAM processes, respectively, induces different cooling rates and temperature gradients (Table 4).\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere P is the laser power [W], s is the scanning speed [mm/s], d is the laser beam diameter [mm], I is the welding current [A], V is the voltage [V], and v is the welding speed [mm/s].",

As already mentioned, within each technique processing parameters have a great influence on thermal cycles.\nStudies assessing the influence of processing parameters on the phase distribution of DSSs have been carried out by several research groups. Lervag et al. [70] assess the impact of current intensity and welding speed on the distribution of ferrite and austenite phases in single track walls by CMT process and SDSS 2507. For the tested range of parameters, authors observed that as heat input increases, the amount of austenite in reheated layers also increased. This behavior is also sustained by Akselsen et al. [64] that also observed a lower amount of ferrite with higher heat input by MIG process and using SDSS 2507.\nThese results confirm the dependence of proportion of ferrite and austenite phases on the processing parameters, Fig. 2. For both PTA-DED and L-DED processes using the same feedstock, an increase in the heat input or energy density caused a decrease in the amount of ferrite, particularly after exposure to several reheating cycles, supporting results in literature. Hence, allowing to conclude that the feedstock composition does not impact the observed relationship between processing parameters and the amount of ferrite in DSSs.\nAs the height of wall increases, the temperature of build rises due to the accumulation of heat, and cooling rates decrease, promoting the formation of austenite and eliminating the ferrite. Hence, it is to be expected that the top\nFig. 2 Amount of ferrite in the last deposited layer and center region of single walls using different heat inputs and energy densities processed by a PTA-DED and b L-DED processes\nlayer that does not undergo reheating, to exhibit a greater amount of ferrite. The amount of ferrite in the top region, that is exposed to a smaller number of thermal cycles, has a stronger dependence on the processing parameters, shown in walls processed both by PTA-DED, Fig. 2a, and L-DED process, Fig. 2b. Therefore, the choice of adequate parameters in each process is essential to obtain a good phase ratio between ferrite and austenite.\nAlthough the build-up of simple walls is an easy method to map the behavior of DSSs processed by AM, the geometry of each part plays a role on the thermal cycle that the material will be exposed to, and cooling rates might differ from those in Table 4. Analyses through numerical simulation have been used to assess the effect of thermal cycles in different geometries on AM of DSSs [56].\nThe control of interlayer temperature and heat input have been shown to minimize precipitation of secondary phases, as  observed by Zhang et al. [67], through experiments using the GTAW process and SDSS 2594. As highlighted in Table 3, DSS precipitation can occur in the temperature range between 550 and 1000 °C, confirming that in additive parts the geometry and interlayer temperature must be carefully evaluated in multilayer parts of DSSs.\nEach process and processing parameters impact the measured ferrite content in multilayer builds differently. Figure 3 summarizes the influence of heat input on the amount of ferrite for different AM processes and DSSs, reported by several investigators. PTA-DED and L-DED data obtained by authors was also included in this graph. It is of relevance to point out that within each process the set up each author used, together with fluctuations in chemical composition of the DSSs, impact on the final microstructure.",

Results for L-PBF process are shown in Fig. 3 to highlight the influence of cooling rate, where ferrite amount is close to 100% in most cases. Due to the fast cooling rates from L-PBF   (10 5 -10 7 K/s), DSSs in the as-built condition does not have the typical microstructure of ferrite and austenite, and a PPHT is required to achieve the right balance between phases [53].\nIams et al. [35] used the L-DED process and different types of DSSs to assess the impact of thermal history on microstructure (LDSS 2101, SSS 2205, and SDSS 2507). These authors found that a high temperature gradient in the first deposited layer accounts for a smaller amount of austenite, and as the number of layers increases, the less severe temperature gradient causes a decrease in the\nIn summary, regardless of the selected additive technique processing, thermal cycles impact the multilayer microstructure as shown by the measured increase in the amount of ferrite towards the top of the processed walls, Fig. 2.

Also, smaller amounts of ferrite and larger grains of austenite are observed in the reheated regions of multilayers regardless of the process used, Fig. 4b and d.\nWhile laser beam AM processes provide a concentrated energy source, which results in high cooling rates and a refined microstructure, arc AM processes provide greater heat inputs, resulting in larger heat accumulation and lower cooling rate, that account for a microstructure with coarser grains, greater residual stresses and distortions that will impact material properties [80].

Studies assessing the influence of shielding gases, particularly the N content, on AM of DSSs processed by L-DED [40] and WAAM [55] show a higher austenite fraction when processing in a N-rich environment. This behavior can be accounted for by the increase on the transformation temperature of ferrite to austenite with increasing N content.",

In addition, the solubilization of secondary phases also occurs during PPHT.

Zhang et al.

The amount of ferrite in the PTA-DED and L-DED samples is very similar, in the range between 21 and 30%, Fig. 5a, b, decreasing considerably in almost all samples when compared to as-built condition.\nRegardless of the wall region or the AM process used, a coarse austenite is present with evidences of diffusion denoted by the roundish edges.

Many studies using WAAM processes reported a balance of ferrite and austenite in the as-build condition that fit the recommendation by the NORSOK M-630 standard [13], eliminating the need for PPHT.\nAs the amount of austenite increases with PPHT, lower microhardness and higher ductility are expected, in agreement with the higher ductility of the FCC lattice [81]. In the as-built condition, the samples from walls processed with L-DED showed considerably higher microhardness than those obtained by PTA-DED, Fig. 8. The austenite grain size is accountable for this difference, as shown in Fig. 4. The austenite grain size of L-DED builds is smaller than in PTA-DED. After PPHT, the microhardness of both samples is very similar, in agreement with the austenite grain size in both microstructures. Analysis of the changes in microhardness along the wall height shows that microhardness decreases from the top layer following the increase in austenite in layers with thermal cycles, in agreement with reports in literature [49, 78]. Although PPHT induces a coarser and more uniform microstructure, differences in hardness along the height of builds are still observed in spite of the lower values measured. In addition to phase balance and presence of secondary phases, hardness on AM of DSSs is also affected by the solid solution strengthening developed by N within the austenite, conferring higher hardness [82].\nFig. 9 Influence of PPHT on the microhardness of DSSs. PTA-DED and L-DED by authors are the results obtained in this work\nThe influence of AM processes and PPHT on the microhardness of DSSs is summarized in Fig. 9. In the as-built condition, WAAM processes induce a lower microhardness due to the higher amount of austenite. The as-built multilayer processed by L-DED and PTA-DED show similar microhardness to WAAM.

As for machinability of DSSs, laser melting of DSSs induces increased hardness, contributing to the increase in thrust forces with cutting speed and feed that favor machinability [86].\nHowever, the characteristics of DSSs depend on the processing route used. The residual stresses induced by thermal gradients of AM processes, allow to measure greater tensile strength, and low ability to plastically deform in the as-built condition, Fig. 10 a and b. PPHT\nFig. 10 Effect of PPHT on a tensile strength and b elongation of DSSs manufactured by different AM processes\nFig. 11 Effect of PPHT on impact toughness of DSSs manufactured by L-DED and WAAM processes\nrecovers the ductility to an acceptable level (elongation above 25% [87]) for an austenitic-ferritic microstructure, offering higher tensile strength compared to wrought condition. The choice of PPHT conditions is important, as at lower PPHT temperatures, the presence of σ phase and nitrides are responsible for a decreased in elongation [48].\nAssessing the as-built L-DED and SDSS 2507, Jiang et al. [37] highlighted that finer austenite grain sizes are beneficial to mechanical strength and mechanical properties can be increased by dislocations. Baghdadchi et al. [39] evaluated the mechanical properties in the as-built and heat-treated conditions, and observed that phase balance of SSS 2209 (by Lw-DED process) obtained by PPHT resulted in similar tensile properties of samples removed from the middle and top regions of the wall. As shown for walls build with PTA-DED and L-DED processes, even after PPHT, the top and middle regions still present differences in the amount of ferrite and austenite phases, which can affect the mechanical behavior.\nIn studies using WAAM processes, associated the lower tensile strength and higher elongation to the presence of greater amount of austenite. Even without PPHT, it is possible to obtain similar tensile strength and elongation to heat-treated L-PBF process.\nFew studies have assessed the impact toughness of AMDSSs in both as-built and heat-treated conditions, Fig. 11, accounting for the large dispersion of data on the as-built L-DED, suggesting that microstructure plays a determining role. Arbo et al. [36] attributed the low absorbed energy to the non-homogeneous distribution of ferrite and formation of coarse grains.\nAs for the low energies absorbed by as-built WAAM, these are related to the formation of σ phase from high interlayer temperatures, deteriorating the impact toughness [64]. As already discussed, PPHT can induce solubilization of secondary phases, mitigating their detrimental effect on toughness.",

        "content": "DSSs are known for their excellent pitting corrosion resistance associated with the high amounts of Cr and Mo. LDSS, SSS, and SDSS have different corrosion resistance due to the fraction of each chemical element, as shown in Table 1.\nFig. 12 Effect of PPHT on pitting corrosion resistance of DSSs manufactured by different AM processes\nCorrosion resistance on AM of DSSs are further affected by processing conditions and PPHT. Other factors that can deteriorate the corrosion resistance are the presence of Cr nitrides and high surface roughness [88].\nThere is a wide dispersion in pitting corrosion resistance results when analyzing as-built WAAM, Fig. 12. The higher amount of Cr and Mo in SDSS is one of the reasons for the higher corrosion resistance. Using the GMAW process and SSS 2209, Zhang et al. [59] developed a new flux-cored wire of DSSs to achieve an acceptable austenite to ferrite ratio. More Cr and Mo, and less Ni were added to flux-core wire to stabilize ferrite and improve corrosion resistance.\nUnlike deposition processes, L-PBF results in a nonuniform distribution of chemical elements and the presence of secondary phases due to high cooling rates, decreasing the corrosion resistance [89]. Papula et al. [46] used a SSS 2205 processed by L-PBF and observed that pitting corrosion resistance was improved by PPHT, resulting in less pit initialization sites. Other studies also evaluate the effect of PPHT on corrosion resistance of SSS [43, 44], and reported that PPHT increased the repassivation ability and localized corrosion resistance due to phase balance.",

        "content": "The maturity of AM technologies allows for the use of a wide range of metallic alloys. With the more intense use of AM technologies arises the need to better understand the response of alloys with a wider metallurgical complexity. DSSs fit this challenge and was the driving force for this review that aimed to bring forward the opportunities that AM of DSSs offer to create a competitive niche for the processing and repair of parts. State-of-the-art knowledge on the metallurgy (microstructure and performance) for additive DSSs processed by DED processes is presented, discussed, and complemented with data DSSs processed by PTA-DED and L-DED.\nThe thermal cycles of multilayer processing challenge the fabrication of additive parts with materials that require a strict balance between phases in the microstructure, as is the case of DSSs. Although PPHT might be use to mitigate the off balance phases in microstructure, post-process steps are additional costs for the industry. Thus, the search for procedures that might avoid or reduce PPHT is an open challenge.\nEnergy density or heat input, interlayer temperature, and geometry are important variables that influence the phase balance of additive DSSs and must be controlled to reduce a large discrepancy between phases. As layers are deposited, the accumulated heat increases; hence, heat management can be used to reduce the significant variation of austenite and ferrite phases.\nIt was shown that the heat source used on AM of DSSs plays a determining role on the microstructure characteristics. Electric arc or laser beam result in different grain size. Using the PTA-DED process, larger austenite grains in the reheated layers were a consequence of the slower cooling, while the concentrated heat source from the laser beam, and consequently faster cooling, resulted in smaller grains. The variation on grain size directly influences the mechanical properties of the components.\nThe use of adequate PPHT parameters can improve the phase balance, remove secondary phases and homogenize chemical composition, improving the mechanical and corrosion properties.\nThe uniformity of mechanical properties along the height of a wall can be affected by the of balance of phases. A higher microhardness at the top of the walls can be related to a greater amount of ferrite. The higher concentration of certain chemical elements in reheated regions can also be detrimental to corrosion resistance due to the formation of secondary phases. Thus, the choice of appropriate parameters for PPHT can mitigate the impact of each of these features in as-build AM parts.\nThis review shows that there are many open challenges to be addressed on AM of DSSs. As highlighted in this work, thermal cycles and PPHT are crucial procedures on AM of DSSs, affecting mechanical properties and corrosion performance.",
