## 1. You are an expert in the field of Duplex Stainless Steel. You are tasked with extracting all experimental details from academic research articles in the DSS field. Please first draft a hierarchy of all the information that you would extract.

As an expert in Duplex Stainless Steel (DSS), I propose the following comprehensive hierarchical framework for extracting experimental details from academic research articles in this field. This structure ensures systematic capture of all critical information necessary to understand, reproduce, and contextualize experimental findings related to DSS materials.

### **I. Material Identification & Classification**
- **Base Alloy Designation**  
  - Standard grade (e.g., EN 1.4462, EN 1.4362, EN 1.4162)  
  - Common commercial names (e.g., DSS 2205, SDSS 2507, HDSS 2707)  
- **Material Subtype**  
  - Conventional duplex  
  - Lean duplex (e.g., EN 1.4162)  
  - Super duplex (e.g., SDSS 2507)  
  - Hyper duplex (e.g., HDSS 2707)  
- **Processing Route**  
  - Wrought (hot/cold rolled, forged)  
  - Additively manufactured (e.g., laser powder bed fusion – LPBF)  
    - As-built LPBF DSS 2205  
    - Heat-treated LPBF DSS 2205

  - N (0.05–0.35%)  
  - Mn, Si, C, S, P (residual/controlled levels)  
- **Actual Measured Composition** (if reported via EDS, ICP, or XRF)  
- **Ferrite–Austenite Balance Indicators**  
  - Calculated ferrite number (FN) or phase fraction  
  - Schaeffler or DeLong diagram predictions

  - Aging treatments (e.g., 700–950°C for embrittlement studies)  
  - Cooling rates (furnace-cooled, air-cooled, water-quenched)  
- **Additive Manufacturing-Specific Parameters** (if applicable)  
  - Laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, layer thickness  
  - Build orientation and support strategy  
  - Post-processing (stress relief, HIP, hot isostatic pressing)

### **IV. Microstructural Characterization**
- **Phase Constitution**  
  - Volume fraction of ferrite (δ) and austenite (γ)  
  - Presence of secondary phases (σ, χ, Cr₂N, M₂₃C₆)

  - Grain size (ASTM or equivalent)  
  - Phase morphology (e.g., Widmanstätten austenite, grain boundary austenite)  
- **Characterization Techniques**  
  - Optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

### **V. Mechanical Properties**
- **Tensile Behavior**  
  - Yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), elongation (%)  
  - Testing temperature (room temp, elevated, cryogenic)  
- **Hardness**  
  - Vickers or Rockwell hardness values  
- **Impact Toughness**  
  - Charpy V-notch energy (J)  
- **Fatigue & Fracture**  
  - Fatigue limit, crack growth rate, fracture toughness (K_IC)

### **VI. Corrosion Performance**
- **Test Environment**  
  - Electrolyte (e.g., 3.5% NaCl, H₂SO₄ + FeCl₃, artificial seawater)  
  - Temperature, pH, aeration  
- **Electrochemical Methods**  
  - Open-circuit potential (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  
  - Critical pitting temperature (CPT), pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN = %Cr + 3.3×%Mo + 16×%N)  
- **Localized Corrosion Observations**  
  - Pitting, crevice corrosion, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility  

---

### **VII. Experimental Conditions & Metadata**
- **Sample Geometry & Preparation**  
  - Dimensions, surface finish, polishing protocol  
- **Standards Followed**  
  - ASTM, ISO, or EN standards for testing (e.g., ASTM G48 for pitting)  
- **Replication & Statistical Reporting**  
  - Number of replicates, error bars, confidence intervals

### **VIII. Contextual & Comparative Data**
- **Reference Materials**  
  - Comparison to wrought counterparts or other DSS grades  
- **Structure–Property–Performance Relationships**  
  - Correlations between microstructure, composition, and observed behavior

This hierarchy is designed to be both exhaustive and adaptable, accommodating conventional wrought alloys as well as emerging variants such as laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)-processed DSS (e.g., LPBF_DSS_2205) and high-alloyed grades like super duplex (SDSS 2507) and hyper duplex (HDSS 2707). It enables consistent data extraction for meta-analyses, materials databases, or machine learning applications in DSS research.
