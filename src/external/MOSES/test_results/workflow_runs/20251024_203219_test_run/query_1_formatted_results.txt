{'summary': 'A comprehensive hierarchy for extracting experimental details from duplex stainless steel (DSS) research articles should be structured around the core material (DSS grades), processing methods, microstructural characteristics (phases, precipitates, balance), and resulting properties (mechanical, corrosion), with detailed sub-categories for specific measurements, conditions, and analytical techniques.', 'key_points': ['The core of the hierarchy is the DSS material itself, with key grades including lean (e.g., EN 1.4162, 2101), standard (e.g., EN 1.4462, 2205), super (e.g., 2507), and hyper-duplex (e.g., 2707) stainless steels, as well as those produced by additive manufacturing like Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) DSS.', 'Processing methods are a critical top-level category, encompassing primary fabrication (e.g., LPBF, Directed Energy Deposition, hot/cold rolling, wrought), post-processing (e.g., solution annealing at specific temperatures like 1050째C for 3h, Hot Isostatic Pressing), and welding (with zones like Heat Affected Zone and Fusion Zone).', 'Microstructural characteristics must be detailed, including the two primary phases (ferrite and austenite) with their volume fractions, morphologies (e.g., columnar ferrite grains, grain boundary austenite), and chemical compositions (e.g., ferrite enriched in Cr/Mo, austenite in Ni/N).', 'The hierarchy must account for a wide range of secondary phases and precipitates that form under specific thermal conditions, such as sigma phase (forms >850째C, highly brittle), chi phase (precursor to sigma, forms 700-750째C), Cr2N/CrN nitrides, and M23C6 carbides, all of which degrade material properties.', 'Mechanical properties to extract include tensile strength, yield strength, hardness (e.g., Vickers), toughness, and impact toughness (e.g., from Charpy V-notch tests), all of which are directly influenced by phase balance and the presence of secondary phases.', 'Corrosion resistance is a key performance metric, with specific focus on pitting corrosion resistance often quantified by the Pitting Resistance Equivalent Number (PREN), and its deterioration due to secondary phases, unbalanced phase ratios, or surface defects like porosity.'], 'background_information': ['The fundamental requirement for DSS is a balanced dual-phase microstructure of roughly equal parts ferrite (body-centered cubic, BCC) and austenite (face-centered cubic, FCC), which is highly sensitive to chemical composition (Cr, Ni, Mo, N content) and thermal history.', 'Additive manufacturing processes like LPBF present unique challenges, as the as-built microstructure is often >98% ferrite due to rapid cooling, necessitating precise post-process heat treatment (PPHT) to achieve the desired phase balance and dissolve harmful precipitates.', 'The formation of secondary phases is a major concern in DSS. Sigma and chi phases are intermetallic compounds that form in the 650-975째C range, consuming the ferrite phase and creating adjacent chromium-depleted zones, which severely embrittle the material and act as initiation sites for pitting corrosion.', 'Analytical and characterization techniques are integral to experimental reporting and should be included in the hierarchy. Key methods include Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) for phase quantification, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Optical Microscopy (OM), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for corrosion analysis.', 'Specific processing parameters significantly influence the final microstructure. For example, in LPBF, laser energy input and interlayer temperature affect austenite content, while in welding, heat input controls the phase ratio in reheated layers. In hot rolling, parameters influence dynamic recrystallization and recovery processes in both phases.'], 'relationships': ['There is a direct and critical relationship between processing parameters (e.g., cooling rate, heat treatment temperature/time) and the resulting microstructure (phase balance, grain size, precipitate formation).', 'The microstructure, in turn, is the primary determinant of both mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. An unbalanced ferrite/austenite ratio or the presence of secondary phases like sigma or Cr2N negatively impacts both property sets.', 'Chemical composition dictates the baseline stability of the phases and the susceptibility to forming harmful precipitates. Elements like Cr and Mo stabilize ferrite but also promote sigma phase, while Ni and N stabilize austenite and enhance the Pitting Resistance Equivalent Number (PREN).', 'In additive manufacturing, a cyclical relationship exists: the rapid solidification of AM creates a non-equilibrium, ferrite-rich structure, which then requires carefully designed post-heat treatment to achieve a balanced, high-performance microstructure, making the extraction of both as-built and post-processed data essential.']}
