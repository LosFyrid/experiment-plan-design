    "text": "Duplex stainless steels; toughness; gas tungsten arc welding; low temperature\nReceived 30 November 2011 Accepted 4 April 2013\nAbstract Duplex stainless steels are often used today in the oil and gas industry because of their high strength and good corrosion resistance. New developments in arctic conditions and at high pressure require the qualification of these materials at very low temperatures. This paper will present the results of an extensive test program dedicated to assessing the low-temperature behavior of various heavy-wall duplex stainless steel forgings, hot isostatically-pressed (HIP) connectors and hot extruded pipes at temperatures down to -60 ◦ C. Several welding processes were also evaluated. The implications for the design of duplex stainless steel production facilities will be discussed.",

They actually showed high impact test values of around 220 J for the weld metal and 150 J at the fusion line of the pipe.\nAfewtests, including metallographic examination, ferrite content, ASTM G48 and impact, were also performed on the butt weld between the pipe and flange. These tests were acceptable, with the exception of some impact values (44, 20 and 19 J) on the S32760 flange side taken on specimens located near the fusion line (CVN notch located 2 mm from the fusion line interface between the pipe and weld metal).\nExtra impact tests on the weld neck of the flange confirmed the brittle behavior of the flange (10, 11, 10 J at -60 ◦ C). Once more, the detrimental e ff ect of precipitation on toughness properties [4] of the flange body was illustrated. No secondary austenite was detected in the weld metal as a typical feature, shown by Gunn [5].\nThese impact test results are reported for comparison in Figure 13.",

The reason for the low-impact energy values on flanges was unknown, but the solution annealing and the cooling rate in particular were strongly suspected. Other parameters such as chemical composition and the forging ratio could also contribute to these low-quality results.\n- F. Busschaert et al.: Revue de Métallurgie 110 , 185-197 (2013)\nFig. 12.

A heat input range from 0.8 to 1.5 kJ / mm was used and well controlled during the weld execution. A maximum interpass temperature of 147 ◦ C was recorded during the WPQ tests. The Charpy V test results of these WPQ are tabulated in Figure 15. The test results on tensile, bend, hardness, metallographic examination and ferrite content, as well as ASTM G48 corrosion tests, were all satisfactory.\nThe impact test results on UNS S32760 to S32760 pipe-to-pipe butt welds complied with the project requirements. Minimum average impact values at -60 ◦ C were about 150 J, 120 J and 150 J in the weld metal, the pipe cap fusion line and the pipe root fusion line, respectively. The Charpy test results on UNS S32550 HIP to S32760 flange complied with the project requirements, with the exception of the HIP root, which had an average value of 39 J. The impact test results of the forged fusion line showed a very large scatter (60 to 210 J). This may be explained by Charpy specimen notches possibly located in the weld metal. No deleterious phases such as sigma or secondary austenite were detected in the weld metal or the heata ff ected zone.",
