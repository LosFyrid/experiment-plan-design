    "text": "Duplex  stainless  steel  (DSS),  such  as  2205  type,  is  increasingly employed  as  structural  materials  in  a  wide  range  of  applications, including oil and gas engineering, marine engineering, and nuclear engineering, due to their superior mechanical properties, economic advantages  and  corrosion  resistance  [1 -3].  The  outstanding  corrosion resistance  of  duplex  stainless  steel  is  markedly  attributed  to  the composition, structure, thickness and electronic properties of passive film formed on the surface [4 -8]. Nevertheless, when DSS is subjected to harsh environment, the passive film is susceptible to be degraded or penetrated,  then  resulting  in  the  rapid  corrosion  and  damage  of  the structure.\nActually, the metallic materials in industries are always used under stressed conditions during service, so investigating the effect of stress (one  of  environmental  factors)  on  the  passivation  behavior  is  very meaningful.  Pervious  extensive  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the application of tensile stress could increase the pitting and stress corrosion  crack  (SCC)  susceptibility  owing  to  its  effect  on  the  mechanical integrity of the brittle passive film [9 -12]. Martin et al. [9] reported that metastable pits nucleated on surface near the yield stress ( σ s), and then oxygen vacancies and the oxygen diffusion increased after reaching σ s due to the activation of dislocations dynamics, and producing stable pits. ¨ Ornek and Engelberg [10] found that the application of 0.2% tensile strain  was  enough  to  induce  SCC  for  2205  DSS  after  368  days  of\n* Corresponding author.

Elastic stress increases the potential drop at the film/solution interface, donor density and defects diffusion coefficient, resulting in the increase of passive current density. High elastic stress ( ≥ 60% σ s) leads to the generation of soluble CrO3, the increase of oxidized Cr and Fe(II) content and the decrease of film thickness, resulting in the quasi-steady-state current density no longer independent of potential. Passive film become denser from spontaneous passivation to primary passivation and Fe(III) compounds dominate the passive film under secondary passivation.\nexposure at 30% RH /50 ◦ C with 1450 µ m/cm 2 chloride. Hou et al. [12] suggested that sever plastic strain and stress could result in the decrease of  critical  pitting  temperature  and  pitting  potential  owing  to  high initiation frequency and growth rate of metastable pits. Most of these studies  were  carried  out  at  high  stress  levels  which  could  introduce plastic deformation, and the effect of stress was thus explained by the brittle mechanical fracture of passive film or dislocation exposed on the surface.",

    "text": "Since elastic stress is the most common in the actual service condition, investigations for the effect of external stress below the yield stress on passive film are also very necessary and meaningful. Unlike plastic stress, elastic stress is less likely to cause the rupture of passive film, but it  can still  accelerate  the corrosion susceptibility. Feng et al. [13,14] believed  that  the  lattice  was  distorted  and  the  strain  energy  density increased for the samples subjected to elastic stress, hence the anodic current density increased. Moreover, Zhu and Luo [15] stated that both tensile stress and compressive stress enhanced the surface activity of Alloy 800 in a ferrocenemethanol solution containing potassium chloride and thiosulfate. The elastic stress can not only change the surface state, but also the electronic properties of passive film. Wang et al. [16] indicated  that  the  elastic  stress  could  accelerate  the  critical  current density, passive current density and donor density of the passive film because the applied stress affected the diffusion coefficient for the vacancy type self-diffusion based on the thermodynamic analysis. Vignal et  al.  [17]  found  that  the  electronic  properties  were  significantly\nL. Chen et al.\nmodified by the elastic stress, and the passive film was heavily doped and the differential  capacitance  decreased  notably  when  the  applied stress was above 70% σ s. Besides, the transport of oxygen vacancies was also  accelerated  when  an  elastic  stress  was  subjected  [18].  Unfortunately, a large number of works have been focusing on passive film of alloys, but the electronic characterization of that film on stainless steel are still somewhat limited. Consequently, the study of the composition, microstructure, charge carrier concentrations, point defect densities of passive film and corrosion behavior of DSS is important, especially for the effect of elastic stress.\nIn this paper, the aim is to deeply and systematically reveal the effect of tensile elastic stress on the electrochemical passivation behavior and surface  chemistry  of  2205  DSS.  The  passive  film  growth/dissolution kinetics, charge carrier density, diffusion coefficient and passive film properties  are  analyzed  using  electrochemical  techniques,  electron backscatter  diffraction  (EBSD)  and  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of passive state (spontaneous, primary and secondary passive) on the film properties is also investigated.",

As observed  in  Fig.  2(a),  (d)  and  (g),  all  three  samples  present  a  few annealing twins in austenite phase, this is due to the low stacking energy of 2205 DSS. In phase maps, the red and green areas represent the ferrite ( α ) and austenite ( γ ), respectively. For all three samples, the austenite ( γ ) grains are arrayed in island like structure and embedded in the ferritic ( α ) matrix, and the diameter of austenite ( γ ) grains are generally larger than  that  of  ferritic  ( α )  matrix,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2(b),  (e)  and  (h). Moreover, there is no notable change in grain size and shape induced by stress. These indicate that 60% σ s  and 90% σ s  cannot change the basic microstructure.  There  is  no  obvious  change  in  the  high-angle  grain boundaries (HAGB, > 15 ◦ of misorientation, represented by thin blue lines)  for  three  samples.  But  the  low-angle  grain  boundaries  (LAGB, between 2 ◦ and 15 ◦ of misorientation, represented by thin red lines) length slightly climbs from 1.16 mm to 1.25 mm as the stress increases from 0% to 60% σ s, and it further increases to 1.54 mm by 90% σ s stress, as presented in Fig. 2(c), (f) and (i). Such increase suggests the strain moderately  accumulated  when  the  sample  is  subjected  to  90% σ s . Meanwhile, the fraction of Σ 3 twin boundaries (represented by thick green lines) has been slightly decreased by stress.\nFig. 3 shows kernel average misorientation (KAM) analysis of samples under 0% σ s,  60% σ s and 90% σ s. In terms of 60% σ s sample, the kernel misorientation distribution is similar to that of 0% σ s sample. For sample with 90% σ s stress, the KAM presents a broader distribution and a higher misorientation value corresponding to the maximum fraction, as shown in Fig. 3(d), indicating slightly intensified strain in phase. Such increase in KAM degree shows that 90% σ s stress could induce higher density of dislocations and other defects [20]. These suggest that lattice distorts induced by stress and can enhance the surface activity [13,14]. Moreover, ferrite has slightly less local strain hot spots than austenite for all three samples, and this phenomenon is more remarkable in the 90% σ s\nFig. 2.

Roughly 400 s, the OCP do not change significantly anymore and gradually attain to the quasi-steady-state. No significant differences are detected in OCP value under different stress levels, and\nFig. 4.

However, the OCP locates at a little more negative value for 2205 DSS subjected to 90% σ s, compared to no stress sample. As Song et al. [21] stated, OCP could reflect the integrity and density of the passive film of stainless steel in the solution, the more positive OCP value, the better passive state of the stainless steel with more compact and denser passive film. Hence, the decrease of OCP is attributed to thinning of the passive film or a less compact passive film formed on the surface. In other words, the passivation state of 2205 DSS becomes modestly worse when stress increases.\nMoreover, the relationship between OCP and thickening rate of oxide film is listed as [22,23]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere E is OCP value, const. is a constant depends on the material, the type and concentration of aggressive anions, δ GLYPH<0> is the thickening rate of passive film per unit decade of time, P is a constant (39 nm/V [23]) and t is time. As presented in Fig. 4(b), OCP is linear with log t for all samples, which is in consistent with Eq. (2). As shown, the slopes decrease with the increase of stress, and then the calculated δ GLYPH<0> values decrease with the increase of stress, i.e., 1.08, 1.05, 1.03 and 0.81 nm/unite decade of time for the 0% σ s, 30% σ s, 60% σ s and 90% σ s  sample, respectively.

In terms of cathodic polarization curves, all curves almost overlap with each other, indicating that stress do not introduce any change to the cathodic process. Moreover, the  cathodic  Tafel  slopes  are  about GLYPH<0> 110 mV/decade,  and  thus  the cathodic reaction is dominated by water reduction [24]. Anodic polarization curves show that 2205 DSS could spontaneously passive because no active-passive current plateau in the range of low overpotential is observed. These curves could be divided into four potential regions [25], e.g., for no stress sample, GLYPH<0> 0.25 V~0.50 V represents primary passive, 0.5 V~0.8 V  is  corresponding  to  transpassive  dissolution  due  to  the dissolution  of  Cr2O3  in  passive  film  to  CrO4 2[26],  0.8 V~0.98 V  is related to secondary passive and above 0.98 V associates with oxygen evolution and passive breakdown, respectively.

Cyclic  potentiodynamic  polarization  curves  of  2205  DSS  applied different levels of stress.\ncurrent density slightly increases, indicating that the resistance to general corrosion weakens. Furthermore, the right shift of anodic polarization curve illustrates higher passive current density induced by stress. According to the work by Heine et al. [27], the passive current density approximately reflects the dissolution rate of passive film during the passive process. Therefore, a higher passive current density leads to a higher dissolution rate in the passive film, suggesting that the passive film with lower protective ability forms under higher stress.\nThe  typical  current-time  curves  in  linear  and  double  logarithmic coordinates of 2205 DSS potentiostatic polarized at 0.2 V for 1 h are displayed in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. It could be seen that the anodic current density for each condition slumps radically in the initial stage because of the rapid nucleation and growth of passive film [28]. Then the anodic current density decreases sluggishly as time prolonged and gradually maintains at a relatively stable value as shown in inserted image in Fig. 6(a), and this is attributed to the balance of film formation and dissolution [29]. Moreover, no remarkable current peak is observed, indicating  that  no  breakdown  events  occurs  during  the  formation  of stable passive film [28,30]. According to previous work by Jones and Greene [5,31], the relationship between current density I and time t can be expressed as I = ψ t GLYPH<0> k ,  where ψ is  a  constant  associated  with  the maximum current density of film-free surface and k is the passivation index which is deemed as an indirect parameter in characterizing the film  properties.  As  presented  in  Fig.  6(b),  all  curves  obey  the  above equation, and value of k is 1.096 for no stress specimen, suggesting a compact  and  highly  protective  passive  film  forms  on  surface  [8]. Furthermore, values of k reduces with the increment of stress because of film degradation, which agrees with OCP results.",

Many researchers [5,8,30,32] stated that the quasi-steady-state was so difficult to be achieved within short time, and Burstein and Daymond [32] reported the passive current density continued to decrease after 15 h. As exhibited in Fig. 6(b), the measured current density of 2205 DSS still persistently slides after polarization for 1 h. Whereas, the aim of this study is to unravel the passivation behavior influenced by stress, and thus the quasi-steady-state current density after 1 h is used like previous works [5,8,33,34]. The current density at quasi-steady-state ( I ss )  is  a constant and independent with potential, i.e., 0.225 μ A/cm 2 and 0.289 μ A/cm 2 for samples with no stress and 30% σ s, respectively, as presented in Fig. 6(c). According to the point defect model (PDM) [26], a passive film whose charge-transfer properties are controlled by the movement of oxygen  vacancies  and  cation  interstitials  is  predicated  to  yield  a quasi-steady-state current density. However, the current density almost increases linearly with the increase of applied potentials when stress increases to 60% σ s  and 90% σ s,  and the slope, i.e., dI ss / dE for sample subjected to 90% σ s is much larger than that of 60% σ s. It indicates that the quasi-steady-state current density I ss  is dependent of the formation potential under these two conditions, the similar phenomena are also observed by Li et al.

This can be attributed to the stress changing the structure of passive film and then enhancing passive film dissolution at high anodic potentials or the oxidation state change of passive film [8, 17, 35, 36].",

For all conditions, the passive film formation potential has a remarkable effect on the EIS.

Moreover, the EIS results almost overlap with each other within primary passive potential region especially for the specimen with no stress and 30% σ s, and such the lack of sensitivity of impedance to the applied potential proves that the electric field strength in the passive film is imperceptive to the anodic potential [38].\nAccording to Priyantha et al.

However, not every time constant can be observed for all conditions due to the different electrochemical system or overlapping of time constants. Based on the above results, the simple Randle circuit R s( Q f R f) as inserted in Fig. 7(a) is employed to analyze the EIS data of 2205 DSS. The variable Q f (CPE, constant phase element) is employed to signify the non-ideal capacitance, which is caused by an inhomogeneous current flow. In this circuit, R s  is solution resistance, Q f and R f  are the constant phase element and resistance of the passive film, respectively. The typical fitted results are listed in Table 1. As shown, n (dispersion coefficient of Q f) ranges from 0.82 to 0.93, indicating that the passive film  formed  on  the  surface  is  relatively  homogenous  and  compact. Moreover, at a fixed stress level, the passive film resistance of sample under primary passive state is the largest, followed by the sample under spontaneous  passivation  state  and  secondary  passivation  state.  For example, for  90% σ s , the R f of sample polarized at 0.2 V is 3.13 ± 0.02 × 10 5 Ω⋅ cm 2 , and twice more than that of sample without polarization (1.45 ± 0.04 × 10 5 Ω⋅ cm 2 ) and polarized at 0.9 V (1.20 ± 0.02 × 10 5 Ω⋅ cm 2 ).  It  indicates  that  passivation  state  significantly changes the surface condition. Similarly, at a certain potential, the R f gradually decreases with increasing stress, suggesting that stress also has a negative influence.\nFig. 8 presents parameters obtained from EIS data, which can reveal the passivation properties of 2205 DSS under different stress. Fig. 8(a) shows that film resistance R f decreases with the increase of stress, suggesting that stress accelerates the film dissolution. Moreover, the value of R f fluctuates with the increase of anodic potential for samples with no stress and 30% σ s, which is corresponding to the well-passivated potential range in the potentiostatic polarization curves (Fig. 6c). However, when stress continues to increase, R f  decreases with increasing anodic potential, which is consistent with Fig. 6(c). This is because stress promotes the dissolution of passive film, concealing the thickness increase.\nThe  effective  capacitance C eff can  be  calculated  by  the  following equation [40]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere Y 0  and n are  the  magnitude  and  dispersion  coefficient  of Q f , respectively, and R s  is solution resistance.

In addition, the film thickness decreases with stress, which is attributed to higher dissolution rate of passive film. The film formation ratio ( r ) can be derived from the linear relationship between d and E [26, 34]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere B is a constant depends on physicochemical conditions and the electrochemical reaction kinetics. The film formation ratio reduces with the growth of stress, indicating the facilitated film dissolution process (Fig. 8(d)).\nL. Chen et al.\nFig. 7.

    "text": "In order to further investigate the semiconductor properties of the passive film, Mott-Schottky measurements are employed. According to Mott-Schottky theory, the space charge capacitance under the depletion condition can be calculated by the following equation [45]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere C is the electrochemical capacitance of the passive film/electrolyte interface, e is the electronic charge (1.6 × 10 GLYPH<0> 19 C), N is the charge carrier density, the donor density N D  for n-type or the acceptor density N A  for  p-type  semiconductors, E fb is  the  flat-band  potential, k is  the Boltzman constant (1.38 × 10 GLYPH<0> 23 J/K), T is the absolute temperature, ε , ε 0  and E have the same physical meaning as above.\nNormally,  the  capacitance  tends  to  increase  with  decreasing  frequency, but it nearly maintains at a constant value in the range of 1 kHz and 10 Hz [46]. At higher frequencies, the capacitance grows because of OH adsorption at the oxide or the enhancement of parallel capacitance with  the  angular  frequency  of  AC  signal.  At  lower  frequencies,  the capacitance rises rapidly again because of low mobility of ionic species located in the space charge layer. In order to eliminate the capacitance dependence on the frequency from the influence of ionic species in the space charge layer, the maximum frequency within the region of nearly constant  capacity  should  be  chosen.  Therefore,  Mott-Schottky  measurements is conducted as 1 kHz like many scholars [5,46].\nThe  Mott-Schottky  plots  recorded  for  spontaneous  passive  film formed on 2205 DSS under different stress levels are presented in Fig. 9 (a), with the similar electronic character indicative of p-n heterojunction behavior.

The presence of two linear regions  detected  in  the  above  Mott-Schottky  curves  are  due  to  two different semiconducting layers, one inner layer is rich in p-type Cr2O3, one outer layer is rich in n-type Fe2O3, with a spinel structure [48,49]. Consequently, the negative slop ( R 1) is related to the presence of Cr2O3, while the positive slop ( R 2) is characteristic of Fe2O3. In the region R 3 (0.45 -0.75 V), the oxide film formed on the sample characterizes p-type semiconductor  property  with  a  calculated  value,  but  no  direct  relationship  between  the  semiconducting  properties  and  charge  carrier concentration can be established. The increase of capacitance is owing to the formation of an inversion layer due to an increasing hole concentration in the valence band [50]. For potentials comprising from 0.75 to 0.95 V ( R 4), a second n-type region presents, this is generally due to the presence of deep donor level in the band gap, which appears that the capacitance  behaviour  of  the  passive  film  is  supported  by  a  band structure  model  of  the  semiconductor  electrode  containing  multiple donor levels in the bandgap. As the potential exceeds 0.95 V ( R 5), the slopes change to negative again, which can be attributed to the cation vacancies generated from the transpassive dissolution of Fe(II)/Fe(III) to FeO3 2following the oxidative dissolution of Cr(III) to Cr( Ⅵ ) in R 3 [25].\nThe values of the charge carrier density of spontaneous passive film formed on 2205 DSS is shown in Fig. 9(b). In the present study, all the calculated acceptor densities ( N A) are from the R 1  and donor densities ( N D) are from the first donor level ( R 2). The N D and N A values are 10 20 -10 21  cm GLYPH<0> 3 in the order of magnitudes, which shows similar results with literatures reported for stainless steels in different environment [5,25, 30]. Such high values mean that passive film formed on 2205 DSS is highly  disordered.  As  presented  in  Fig.  9(b),  the N D  increases  from 5.89 × 10 20 to 8.33 × 10 20  cm GLYPH<0> 3 as stress increases from 0% to 90% σ s . The N A  shows the similar tendency with N D, the same results are also detected by Vignal et al. [17] and Feng et al. [13]. It is because the doping  of  the  outer  hydroxide  depends  on  the  stress  level  [17].  According to the description of point defects by Tanahashi and Inoue [51], the elastic tensile stress results in an increment in the formation of interstitials due to the change of volume. Because the major charge carriers in the space layer are oxygen vacancies and cation interstitials in this paper, it can be speculated that the elastic tensile stress accelerates the formation of cation interstitials. Generally, a higher N D  means that the stability of passive film is worse and the electrochemical reaction at the film/solution becomes more active. Therefore, this process promotes the dissolution of passive film. In addition, the value of N D  agrees with the film resistance of EIS results, as shown in Fig. 8(a).",

Passive  film  formed  on  2205  DSS  exhibits  n-type semiconductor behavior under all conditions, which is evidenced by the generally positive slope within the sweep potential range. It shows that the major charge carriers in the space charge layer are electrons and the impurities states are donor states. The plots almost overlap with each other when samples subjected to 90% σ s, which is attributed to simultaneous effect of potential and stress.\nFig.  10(e)  presents  the  calculated  donor  densities  of  passive  film formed under different conditions. Values of N D  are 10 20  cm GLYPH<0> 3 in the order of magnitudes. Moreover, N D  is  larger for samples with higher stress. It is also observed that the donor carrier density decreases with the  increase  of  film  formation  potential  when  the  stress  is  less  than 90% σ s, because anodic polarization can eliminate some defects in the passive  film  and  then  the  passive  film  becomes  more  compact  [34]. However, N D fluctuates with potential when the stress reaches at 90% σ s , indicating that such high elastic stress introduces remarkable difference to the surface. PDM implies that N D  is associated with the generation rate at metal/film interface and the annihilation rate at film/solution interface, and both two rates increase as the formation potential shifts to more noble [26]. Hence, the generation rate has a larger growth for 90% σ s sample compared to sample subjected to lower stress, and this is consistent with Fig. 6(c).\nFrom pervious literatures, the relationship between N D and E can be described as [32,52]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere ω 1, b and ω 2 are  the  parameters  derived  from  fitting  results, shown in Fig. 10(e). Diffusion coefficient ( D 0) of point defects is a key parameter to reflect the transport of points defects and the film properties,  and because the E 0  values are in the range of 1.5 -2.5 MV/cm (Fig. 8d), the following equation is more proper [41]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere a is the half-jump distance of the migrating point defect (0.4 nm [53]), z is the charge number of mobile point defect (2), F is the Faraday constant  (96485 C/mol), R is  the  gas  constant  (8.314 J/K ⋅ mol)  and other parameters are same as above. Thus, D 0  are 3.40 × 10 GLYPH<0> 18 cm 2 /s and 3.88 × 10 GLYPH<0> 18 cm 2 /s for specimen without stress and with 30% σ s , respectively.  Moreover,  the  values  of D 0 increase  from  4.14 × 10 GLYPH<0> 18 cm 2 /s  to  5.19 × 10 GLYPH<0> 18 cm 2 /s  for  60% σ s specimens  as  the  potential increased from 0 V to 0.4 V. The increase of D 0  may promote pit initial rate and passive film localized breakdown [54].\nL. Chen et al.\nFig. 10.

Fig. 11 displays the high dissolution XPS of Fe 2p3/2, Cr 2p3/2 and O 1 s of the passive film formed on 2205 DSS and corresponding ratios of Fe 2 + /Fe 3 + , Crox/Crhy, O 2/OH and Feox + hy/Crox + hy. The binding energy of each constituent used for fitting is presented in Table 2. It should be noted that Fe3O4 is treated as FeO ⋅ Fe2O3 in the calculation of Fe 2 + /Fe 3 + percentage. It can be seen that the composition of outmost layer of passive film is complex, which is mainly composed of oxides and hydroxides of iron and chromium.\nAs shown in Fig. 11(d), the Fe 2 + /Fe 3 + ratio increases continuously with increasing tensile stress, indicating that the stability of passive film is  degraded.  As  the  Fe 2 + specie in passive film increases, due to the doping state of Fe 2 + , more oxygen vacancies are formed in passive film as  the  electric  charges  balance  [55].  Meanwhile,  the  Fe(III)-contain constituents  are  the  main  iron  oxidized  compositions  in  the  passive film because Fe 2 + /Fe 3 + ratios are all small than 1 in spite of different stress.  In  terms  of  Cr,  three  contributions (metallic  Cr, Cr2O3  and Cr (OH)3) are detected for no stress and 30% σ s samples. Whereas, the peak of CrO3  is surprisingly observed for specimens subjected to 60% σ s and 90% σ s, which should not be present in the passive film based on E-pH diagrams. According to the work of Olsson [56], CrO3 can coexist with Cr2O3 in passive film because of their similar standard free enthalpies. Even though there is no sufficient and direct evidence to demonstrate the connection between the presence of CrO3  in the passive film and passivation  behavior  of  stainless  steel,  Luo  et  al.  [47]  observed  the appearance of CrO3  in samples with cold formation occurred simultaneously with the relatively lower corrosion resistance. This indicates that the corrosion resistance of samples with 60% σ s and 90% σ s becomes worse, agreeing with the above results. Furthermore, the Crox/Crhy ratio gradually increases to close to 1 when specimen is subjected to higher stress, suggesting that the percentage of Cr(OH)3 decreases but Cr(OH)3 is still the dominant species. Moreover, the ratio of O 2/OH increases with stress in the spectra of O1s, implying the increase of oxides and/or\nL. Chen et al.\nFig. 11.

[47], the chemisorbed water (H2O-M-H2O) plays an important role in the stability of passive film, it could not only participate the self-repairing action of the passive film but also capture the dissolving metal ions and form protective layer. It is found that stress reduces the content of chemisorbed water (533 eV) in passive film, showing injurious effects on the corrosion resistance of 2205 DSS. The increase of Feox + hy/Crox + hy  with increasing stress suggests that the percentage of chromium decreases in outer layer, leading to worse protection. And the ratio of Feox + hy/Crox + hy  are all above 1, indicating that oxidized Fe dominates the composition of passive film.\nThree  different  passivation  states,  i.e.,  spontaneous  passivation (OCP), primary passivation (0.2 V) and secondary passivation (0.9 V) are investigated because the applied potential also has significant effects on passive film. The Fe 2 + /Fe 3 + ratio reduce monotonously when noble potential applied, which is attributed to the transformation from Fe(II) to Fe(III) compounds, as presented in Fig. 11(d). The variation of Cr is dominated by the increase of oxides and the decrease of hydroxides, resulting in the increase of Crox/Crhy  ratio with potential. At the same time, the ratio of O 2/OH and Feox + hy/Crox + hy  increase with increasing imposed potential. These similar results are also found in previous literatures [5,25,57,58], this is because the increasing film formation potential introduces a small degree of hydration and thus decreases the carrier densities.",

As the sputtering time prolongs, the signal of Fe 0 strengthens but that of Fe oxides weakens for both specimens without stress and with 90% σ s. The same tendency can be observed in peaks of Cr 0 and Cr oxides. In addition, the O element can be still detected even after sputtering for 110 s due to oxygen pollution, which indicates that the adsorption rate of oxygen as impurity in argon is closely equivalent to the removal rate of oxide film on the sample as the sputtering etching\nL.

Because of this, it is difficult to define a sharp film/metal interface, where the oxygen concentration  should  change  from  that  of  oxide  stoichiometry  to  zero  in theoretically. With the increase of sputtering time, peaks of Fe(OH)3 and FeOOH  cannot  be  observed  gradually  for  both  two  samples.  After sputtering for 50 s, the peak of Fe2O3 still exists for the sample without stress, while it disappears for the sample with 90% σ s. It indicates that Fe (III) compounds mainly exist in the outer layer of passive film and stress can decrease its thickness. Cr spectra show similar variation with Fe spectra, CrO3 only exists in the outmost layer and it cannot be detected even after 10 s for 90% σ s sample, but more time is needed for Cr(OH)3 to disappear for both two samples (Fig. 12(b) and (e), Fig. 13(c) and (d)). Fig.  13  shows  the  atomic  percent  depth  profiles  of  elements  and distribution of different components. It should be noted that the half of O element in the passive film is considered as its corresponding thickness. The thickness marked in the pictures for samples without stress and with 90% σ s are about 3.78 nm and 3.21 nm, i.e., 37.8 s and 32.1 s for sputtering time (Fig. 13(a) and (b)), respectively. Moreover, the outer layer of the passive film formed on the sample with 90% σ s stress has higher Fe content and lower Cr and O content than that formed on the sample without stress, demonstrating that stress reduces the thickness of passive film and accelerates the dissolution of Cr. After normalization treatment, the percentage of different compounds can be calculated and the results are presented in Fig. 13(c) and (d). According to the PDM, the passive film can be divided into an outer layer and an inner layer, but these two layers are difficult to be clearly distinguished through XPS results since the contamination of oxygen conceals boundary characters. However, the distribution of Fe and Cr compounds shows that Fe is enriched in the outer layer and Cr in the inner layer. To be more precise, the outer layer is dominated by Fe(III) compounds and the inner layer mainly consists of Cr2O3  and Fe(II) compounds [25]. Additionally, the percentages of Fe and Cr in the passive film are more than 80% and increase gradually to the value for the matrix.",

It is accepted that the passive film formation process is in a dynamic equilibrium state, and determined by two sides, i.e., growth at the metal/film interface and dissolution at the film/solution interface. The elastic stress can lead to localized lattice distortion and higher activation energy [13,15], and metal dissolution preferentially occurs, then accelerating the nucleation of passive film, as demonstrated by the increase of LAGB and KAM and the decrease of Σ 3 twin boundaries in Figs. 2 and 3. This effect will lead to higher reaction rate for the specimen with stress, and thus higher growth rate of passive film. Because of higher growth rate, the diffusion time of atoms, ions and electrons  to  the  \"right\"  position  is  limited,  and  more  defects  will  be generated in the passive film [33]. Meanwhile, the elastic tensile stress can promote the generation of cation interstitials [51]. As a result, the donor  density  will  increase  when  a  specimen  is  subjected  stress,  as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. As reported in literatures, the film dissolution rate i d is a function of the potential drop at film/solution interface φ f / s , which is the decisive factor controlling the dissolution rate of passive film, and can be calculated by the following expression [16,60 -62]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere i 0 d is the exchange current density, α is the symmetry coefficient, m is the number of electrons, Δ E is the applied potential, φ m / f is the potential  drop  at  the  metal/film  interface  and φ f is  the  potential  drop within film ( E 0 × d ). EIS and XPS results show that the film thickness d is significantly decreased by stress, while E 0 is increased modestly (Figs. 8 and 13). As a result, the φ f / s increases with stress, accelerating the film dissolution process. Even though the growth and dissolution rates increase with stress, the increment in the dissolution rate of passive film is more remarkable, and thus decreasing formation rate of passive film, OCP value E (Fig. 4) and film formation ratio r (Fig. 8). Meanwhile, passive current density (Fig. 5) and quasi-steady-state current density I ss (Fig. 6) increase. Nevertheless, according to the PDM, the I ss of an n-type semi-conductive  passive  film  is  related  to  the  density  ( N D )  and  the diffusion coefficient ( D 0) of point defects through the passive film [63]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nHence, the increase of I ss is also demonstrated by the increment in ND and D 0 .\nL.

    "text": "As mentioned above, the surface activity is improved by the elastic stress, and thus passive film composition is changed. Stress promotes the dissolution of Fe(III), contributing to the increment in Fe 2 + /Fe 3 + ratio (Fig. 11). Then the increase of Fe(II) percentage leads to the growth in donor  density  due  to  Fe(II)  is  the  main  cation  interstitial  (Fig.  10). Moreover, when sample is subjected to 60% or 90% σ s, CrO3  generates [25,64]:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nand/or:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nAnd  CrO3 is  related  to  soluble  chromium  ions  Cr2O4 2,  which contribute to the dissolution process of the passive film. Although the passive  film  is  not  breakdown  in  this  work,  the  slight  transpassive dissolution may cause the slight increment in the donor density. Besides, the dissolution of Cr(III) is more notable than that of Fe(III), leading to the  increase  of  Feox + hy/Crox + hy within  the  surface  layer.  The  tensile elastic stress also has a dehydration effect, which results in an increase of O 2/OH ratio.  As  a  result,  the  protectiveness  of  the  passive  film  decreases, as shown in Fig. 8. The passive film thickness is also reduced by the elastic stress as demonstrated by EIS and XPS results. The calculated film thickness obtained from the effective capacitance C eff of EIS results for 0% and 90% σ s samples formed at 0.2 V are approximately 2.93 nm and 2.32 nm (Fig. 8), respectively. This agrees with XPS depth profiles, in  which the  equivalent  thicknesses  simply  estimated using the  halfheight of O element are about 3.78 nm and 3.21 nm (Fig. 13), respectively, which proves thinning of the passive film after subjecting stress, although this method is not very precise due to oxygen pollution and destruction by sputtering.",

    "text": "Passive  film  formed  under  OCP  is  considered  as  spontaneous passivation state, the film is relatively thin and less protective due to low driving force to three-dimensional growth of oxide particles and their coalescence [5]. According to pervious literatures [25], the rates of the nucleation  and  growth  process  of  passive  films  are  accelerated  by overpotential. In other words, the number and size of oxide particles increase with increasing formation potential. As the anodic potential 0.2 V is applied, the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) is promoted at the interface  between  the  inner  and  outer  layers,  as  indicated  by  the\nFig. 14.

During the film growth, the inner layer also becomes thicker, resulting in the increase in the thickness and compactness of passive film (Fig. 8). Meanwhile, potential also has a hydration effect, leading to the dominant composition transforms from hydroxides to oxides, as indicated by Fig. 11(d). As the film formation potential  shifted  to  0.9 V,  the  energy  bands  bend  obviously  and  the Fermi-level is lower than the valence band edge at the outmost surface layer of the passive film [65], resulting in the transpassive dissolution of chromium. The dissolution of Cr(III) to Cr( Ⅵ ) contributes to the increase of Crox/Crhy  and Feox + hy/Crox + hy  ratios (Fig. 11d). Meanwhile, the Fe (III) compounds become the main composition due to its stability at high potential (Fig. 11d), this leads to a decrement of passivity and protectiveness of the passive film (Fig. 8).",

The main conclusions are as follows:\n- (1)  Even though elastic stress promotes the growth rate of passive film by modifying the surface state, it significantly accelerates the dissolution process by the increase in potential drop at the film/ solution interface ( φ f / s ), donor density ( N D ) and diffusion coefficient of defects ( D 0), and thus leading to higher passive current density  and  quasi-steady-state  current  density  and  lower  open circuit potential and film resistance.\n- (2)  High elastic stress ( ≥ 60% σ s) leads to the generation of soluble CrO3,  the  increase  of  oxidized  Cr  and  Fe(II)  content  and  the decrease  of  film  thickness,  which  results  in  the  increment  of quasi-steady-state current density with the increase of anodic film formation potential.\n- (3)  A  relatively  thin  and  less  protective  passive  film  forms  under spontaneous passivation  state,  while  a  denser  film  with  lower Fe 2 + /Fe 3 + ratio is created in primary passive region due to higher rates of the nucleation and growth process of passive film. In the secondary passive region, Crox/Crhy  and Feox + hy/Crox + hy  ratios increase remarkably because chromium is oxidized and dissolved at the layer surface, resulting in the decrease of film resistance, even lower than that under spontaneous passivation state.",
