    "text": "The duplex stainless steel was currently an alternative to traditional austenitic stainless steel due to its high strength, acceptable plasticity and lower nickel concentration [1]. The lower nickel concentration madeit advantageous as a biomaterial in the human body. The mechanical properties of the duplex steels depended strongly on stresses partitioning between austenitic and ferritic grains as well as morphological and crystallographic textures in ferrite and austenitic phases [2]. These superior performances originated from a mixture of austenitic and ferritic phases. Jiménez et al. [3] suggested that superplastic properties of austenite/ferrite stainless steel were attributed to grain boundary sliding. In situ tensile tests from atomic force microscope showed that plane slips occurred at austenitic grains in a low strain level for austenitic -ferritic duplex stainless steel. The slip lines with different orientations were distributed homogeneously within all the austenitic grains, while only a few signs of plastic deformation were activated in ferritic grains in a high strain level [4]. The number of slip bands in both phases increased with the applied plastic strain for duplex stainless steel [5]. In situ observations revealed that the plastic deformation occurred within the soft austenitic phase at the beginning of the deformation stage, while plastic deformation occurred by slip gliding in the\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Beijing Key Laboratory of Fine Ceramics, Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, Tsinghua University, Zhongguancun Street, Haidian District, Beijing 100084, China.\nE-mail addresses: ljltsinghua@126.com (L.

    "text": "The coarse grained 2205 duplex stainless steel is shown in Fig. 1a. The microstructure of the solution annealed sample shows a bulgy ferrite phase and concave austenite phase. The result of Energy Dispersive Spectrometer shows that the chromium and molybdenum enrich ferritic phase, while nitrogen and nickel enrich austenitic phase in Fig. 1b. After the cold rolling, a lot of austenite grains are transformed into α ′ -martensite in Fig. 1c. α ′ -Martensite contains high density dislocations. The XRD result also shows diffraction peak of α ′ -martensite (not shown here). In addition, ferrite grains are also signi /uniFB01 cantly re /uniFB01 ned. The dislocation slip is the main mechanism of grain re /uniFB01 nement by the dislocation cell and dislocation substructure. In the early stage of deformation, austenitic phase underwent rapid grain subdivision caused by twinning and the generation of dislocations [11]. During the large deformation stage, the dislocation structures could transform into grains. The re /uniFB01 nement of the microstructure in the austenitic phase was much more obvious than that in ferritic one. After annealing, ultra /uniFB01 ne 2205 duplex stainless steels with the average size of 480 nm are obtained in Fig. 1d. The strain induced α ′ -martensite could be formed during lowcycle fatigue [12] and cold rolling for duplex stainless steels [13]. A\nlarge number of α ′ -martensites were produced due to the preferential deformation of austenite. However, the compression results also con/uniFB01 rmed that the strength of ferritic phase was higher than the austenitic phase [14]. Considering the very high hardness of strain induced α ′ -martensite, high dislocation density in ferritic phase could induce its high hardness. Mechanical properties of 2205 duplex stainless steel were directly affected by the initial microstructures [15]. Moreover, grain size and grain orientation change will undoubtedly affect its hardness. The change of microstructures will be investigated by the following TEM observation. The statistical distributions of ferritic phase and austenitic phase are shown in Fig. 1e and f, respectively. Comparing with austenitic phase, double grain distribution is observed in ferritic phase. Moreover, the austenitic phase is slightly coarser than ferritic phase. It can be found that the austenitic grain is more uniform than ferritic grain.\nTrue stress -strain plots of the coarse grained and ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex stainless steels are showed in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the yield strength and elongation of ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 stainless steel are much higher than those of coarse grained one. The yield strength and elongation is 452 MPa and 39% for ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex stainless steel, while the corresponding value is 310 MPa and 26% for coarse grained one. Misra et al. [16] studied and found that nano/ultra /uniFB01 ne 304 stainless steel showed higher strength than coarse grained one. They suggested that improved strength was attributed to increased stability of austenitic phase due to a decrease in grain size. Our study indicates that grain re /uniFB01 nement improves both strength and plasticity of the 2205 stainless steel.",

Note that increasing of the microhardness value in ferritic phases is more signi /uniFB01 cant than that in austenitic phase. This indicates that the tensile strain has a greater effect on ferritic phase than austenitic phase. The ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex stainless steel has higher microhardness than coarse grained one with the increasing of strain in Fig. 3b. The increasing in hardness is attributed to the grain re /uniFB01 nement and the change of microstructures. Comparing with coarse grained 2205 duplex stainless steel,\nFig. 4.

    "text": "strain, the dislocation density increases in two phases, Moreover, tangle of dislocation occurs in the austenitic grains in Fig. 5b. Many shear bands occur in the austenite grains with the further increasing of strain in Fig. 5c. In addition, some intersections of shear bands act as the nucleation sites for α ′ -martensite. The analytical transmission electron microscopy studies showed that martensitic transformation mechanisms of the austenitic phase included γ (fcc) → ε (hcp), γ (fcc) → α ′ (bcc) and γ (fcc) → ε (hcp) → α ′ (bcc) [17]. Cao et al. found that the neighbouring ferrite and austenite always maintained similar hardness during plastic deformation [18]. Moreover, the plastic deformation of ferritic phase occurred mainly via dislocation activities, while the plastic deformation of austenitic phase evolved by dislocation slip and deformation twinning. Grain re /uniFB01 nement could affect the deformation mechanism and further affect the mechanical properties.\nFig. 6a -c show microstructures of ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex stainless steels with different strain levels. Some planar dislocations occur at intragranular and grain boundaries in Fig. 6a. The dislocation density increases due to higher strain in Fig. 6b. Deformation twinning is activated in ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex stainless steels due to large strain in Fig. 6c.\nThe interactions between the dislocations and twin boundaries play a signi /uniFB01 cant role in the plastic deformation process for ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205duplex stainless steel, especially for sample with large strain. Once the dislocations are emitted at the boundaries, then they move through the grain interior. This process can improve plasticity [19]. When dislocations are blocked at twin boundaries, higher stress is needed to make dislocations pass through twin boundaries, which results in higher tensile strength. Moreover, more deformation twins in ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex stainless steel inhibit dislocation slip and α ′ -martensite transformation. Grain re /uniFB01 nement inhibits the transformation of α ′ -martensite for 2205 duplex stainless steel. This was attributed to a fact that the α ′ -martensite transformation was saturated because of the austenitic grain re /uniFB01 nement and the increasing of austenite stabilization for a near-Ni-free, Mn -N bearing duplex stainless steel [20]. Comparing with tensile strength (over 1000 MPa) and 50% elongation in Mn -N bearing duplex stainless steel [20], our ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex\nstainless steel showed lower elongation and slightly lower tensile strength. This was mainly attributed to a fact that very low stacking fault energy of austenitic phase in Mn -N bearing duplex stainless steel promoted strain induced α ′ -martensite transformation. The transformation induced plasticity improved elongation of Mn -Nbearing duplex stainless steel [20]. However, we found that grain re /uniFB01 nement of 2205 duplex stainless steel inhibited the transformation of α ′ -martensite, which resulted in lower elongation. In addition, grain re /uniFB01 nement also decreased elongation of 2205 duplex stainless steel. However, the grain re /uniFB01 nement of 2205 duplex stainless steel induced deformation twin which improved tensile strength and elongation.",

Both of them have similar anodic polarization behaviour. The corrosion potential of ultra /uniFB01 ne grained and coarse grained duplex stainless steels in 0.1 M NaCl solution is -0.268 VSCE, and -0.377 VSCE, respectively, a little positive of the former than the latter is observed. Besides, passive current of ultra /uniFB01 ne grained duplex stainless steel is lower than that of the coarse grain one. This implies that the grain re /uniFB01 nement affects the structure and composition of the passive /uniFB01 lms on the surface of duplex stainless steel. Zheng et al. [21] found that thickness and composition of the passive /uniFB01 lm formed on both as-received and nanocrystalline 304 stainless steel by equal channel angular pressed in 0.5 M H2SO4 at room temperature showed little difference. However, more grain boundaries due to grain re /uniFB01 nement could improve the chromium diffusion and promoted to the forming of compact passive /uniFB01 lm. Therefore, Balusamy et al. [22] illustrated that nanocrystallisation induced by a surface mechanical attrition treatment increased the corrosion resistance of 409 stainless steels.\nThe corrosion resistance of coarse grained and ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex stainless steels in 0.1 M NaCl solution is also evaluated by open circuit potential (OCP) tests. Fig. 7b shows that the OCP shifts to more positive potential in two samples. The OCP of ultra /uniFB01 ne grained 2205 duplex stainless steel was higher than that of coarse grained one in 0.1 M NaCl solution. The more positive value of the OCP could be attributed to thickening of the passive /uniFB01 lm spontaneously formed on the\nFig. 8.

The diameter of the semicircle of Nyquist plot is directly proportional to corrosion resistance [24]. This suggests that charge transfer resistance of the passive /uniFB01 lm increases due to grain re /uniFB01 nement for 2205 duplex stainless steels in sodium chloride solution. The Bode plots of two duplex stainless steels are in Fig. 8b. A time constant is observed. The high angles at low frequencies are typical characteristic for passivated materials in Bode plots [25]. The passive /uniFB01 lm formed on the surface of the 2205 duplex stainless steel has a bilayer structure, predominantly contained Fe species and Cr-oxide [26]. The heterogeneous passive /uniFB01 lm was formed on both phases of the duplex stainless steel due to the differences in chemical composition between austenitic and ferritic phases [27] .Compared to γ -phase, Fe species in passive /uniFB01 lm of α -phase were more stable due to the higher content of Mo in α -phase for 2205 duplex stainless steel in neutral 3.5% NaCl solution [28]. However, the superior stability of Cr (III) species in the passive layer of γ -phase might result from the higher content of Ni in γ -phase. In addition, effect of coupling of two phases was bene /uniFB01 cial to the passive behaviour of 2205 duplex stainless steel. Therefore, the doping densities, the thickness and chemical compositions of the passive /uniFB01 lm could affect the corrosion resistance of the 2205 duplex stainless steel in the chlorine ion environment.
