    "text": "Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs) is a device that directly and efficiently converts chemical energy into electricity. Thus it is considered as a clean energy device beyond petroleum [1]. Non-porous graphite is regarded as excellent bipolar plates due to its high conductivity and excellent corrosion resistance. However, its main weakness is high cost, poor machining property and brittleness for portable application [2]. The stainless steels are also widely accepted as a promising bipolar plates materials [3]. However, its corrosion is still a serious problem in the acidic environment of PEMFC operation. In addition, the corrosion products tend to contaminate the catalysts and reduce the overall efficiency of the cell [4]. Laser surface alloying of 304 stainless steel with Mo could be an appropriate technique to enhance the resistance to pitting and erosion-corrosion in NaCl solution [5]. The formation of molybdenum insoluble oxides enhanced the corrosion performance of AISI 304 and 316 stainless steels in H2SO4 solution [6]. The enrichment of Cr and Mo in the oxide layer had improved the corrosion resistance of the AISI 304 and AISI 316 stainless steels [7,8]. Mo oxides decreased active surface sites of ferritic stainless steels in acid solution [9].

    "text": "Surface molybdenum enrichment on 2205 duplex stainless steel was obtained by the ball milling technique. The electrochemical results showed molybdenum enrichment on the surface of 2205 duplex stainless steel improved its corrosion resistance in a typical proton exchange membrane fuel cell environment. This was mainly attributed to higher molybdenum content in the passive film formed on 2205 duplex stainless steel after ball milling. The decreased donor and acceptor concentrations improved significantly the corrosion resistance of surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel bipolar plates in the simulated cathodic proton exchange membrane fuel cells environment. In addition, the interfacial contact resistance of the 2205 duplex stainless steel bipolar plates slightly decreased due to surface molybdenum enrichment.\n/C211 2017 Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons. org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\nand interfacial contact resistance (ICR) measurement implied that the molybdenum nitride modified 304 stainless steel improved the corrosion resistance and ICR [10]. The study showed that the 316L stainless steel was in the passive state in simulating the cathode PEMFCs environment, moreover, the passive current density decreased and the passive potential region enlarged with increasing Mo content [11]. The compactness and corrosion resistance of the passive film formed on 316L stainless steel enhanced with the increasing of Mo content. Moreover, Mo decreased the donor and acceptor densities in the inner and outer layers of the passive films and increased the Cr2O3 content in the passive films. Compared with the uncoated 316L stainless steel, all the Ti-Mo-N film coated ones showed enhanced corrosion resistance in simulating the cathode PEMFCs environment [12]. However, when Mo content in the Ti-Mo-N films increased, the corrosion resistance of the TiMo-N film gradually degraded. In addition, the investigation showed that molybdate firstly formed in the passive film and then later partially dissolved into a solution [13].\nDespite some studies focused on the effect of the Mo on the passivity of austenitic stainless steel, the studies on the effect of surface molybdenum enrichment on the corrosion behaviors of the 2205 duplex stainless steel in simulating the cathode PEMFCs environment was still scarce. Therefore, the objective of this work is to investigate the effect of surface molybdenum enrichment by ball milling on the corrosion behavior of 2205 duplex stainless steel in the simulated PEMFCs cathodic environment by electrochemical\nexperiment and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. In addition, the effect of surface molybdenum enrichment on ICR was also evaluated.",

The as-received samples were annealed at 1100 /C176 C for 1 h and water-quenched for solution treatment. The 2205 duplex stainless steel plate was cut to square with a dimension of 10 mm /C2 10 mm /C2 1 mm for test. The sample and nano Mo powder mixtures were loaded into a vacuum ball milling tank with stainless steel balls. The ball to powder weight ratio was 10:1. The ball milling process was performed at a rotational speed of 300 rpm for 300 h at room temperature. The milling process was periodically interrupted for half an hour every 2 h to avoid excessive heating of the vials. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried out by a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer using Cu K a (0.154056 nm) by radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM JSM5800) was used for morphology observation.\nElectrochemical test\nCHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua instrument Co. Shanghai, China) was used for electrochemical measurements. The counter electrode is a large thin platinum foil and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) is the reference electrode. The potential described in this study is relative to the SCE. The electrochemical tests were conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with 2 ppm HF solution at 70 /C176 C. The applied potentiostatic polarizations were carried out at 0.6 VSCE in air-purged solution for simulating the cathode PEMFCs environment. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in cathode PEMFCs environment also were conducted at 0.6 VSCE. The peak to peak amplitude of the sinusoidal perturbation signals of 5 mV was used during the EIS measurements. The frequency ranged from 100 kHz to 10 mHz.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement\nThe surface compositions of two 2205 duplex stainless steels were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera SXM) with monochromatized Al Ka source. The binding energy and relative intensity were analyzed to obtain further information about the chemical states of surface passive films. The C 1s peak from adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV was used as a reference to correct the charging shifts. XPSPeak4.1 software was used to fit obtained XPS experiment data.\nICR test\nThe ICR was obtained by measuring the voltage drop across the surface contacts at room temperature. The ICR between the sample and carbon paper was measured. Two pieces of carbon papers were sandwiched between the stainless steel and two copper plates. An outside force was applied on the two insulators above and below copper plates, respectively. The needed compaction force was applied by weight which was provided by a sanki hydraulic press. A milliohm meter (ZY9858) with a resolution of 0.1 lX was used for measurement of total resistance under different compaction forces. The compaction forces changed from 50 to 500 N cm -2 .",

The microstructure of the solution annealed sample shows bulgy ferritic phase and concave austenitic phase. The surface is undulating for molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel in Fig. 1b. Liu et al. [14] reported significant grain refinement and severe plastic deformation in the top layer for 316L stainless steel as a result of ultrasonic shot peening. XRD was used to study the phase transformations due to ball milling and surface molybdenum. The ferritic and austenitic phases are detected in solid solution 2205 duplex stainless steels by XRD owing to their different crystal structure in Fig. 1c. After ball milling and surface molybdenum enrichment, the intensities of the diffraction peaks of ferritic and austenitic phases significantly change. Moreover, some strain induce a '-martensitic phases are observed after ball milling and surface molybdenum enrichment due to several plastic deformation. It is worthwhile to note that the ferritic phase has a preferred orientation (1 1 0) in solution annealed 2205 duplex stainless steel, while ferrite and a '-martensite expand along a preferred orientation (2 0 0) in surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel in Fig. 1b. Moreover, the austenitic phase has a preferred orientation (1 1 1) in solution annealed 2205 duplex stainless steel, while austenitic phase expands along a preferred orientation (2 2 0) in surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel. No intermetallic compounds are observed in surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel.\nThe result of Energy Dispersive Spectrometer shows that the chromium and molybdenum enrichment in ferritic phase in Fig. 2a, while nitrogen and nickel enrichment in austenitic phase for solution annealed 2205 duplex stainless steel in Fig. 2b. The result of Energy Dispersive Spectrometer also shows that the molybdenum enriches significantly on ball milled 2205 duplex stainless steel in Fig. 1c.\nFig. 3a shows anodic polarization curves for solid solution and surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steels in cathode PEMFCs environment. The results of potentiodynamic tests show that solid solution and surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steels have similar corrosion potential and breakdown potential in cathode PEMFCs environment. However, surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel has lower passivated current than solid solution one in cathode PEMFCs environment. This indicates that enriched molybdenum on the surface by ball milling inhibits the dissolution of the passive film on 2205 duplex stainless steel bipolar plates in cathode PEMFCs environment. Therefore, it can be concluded that the surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel is suitable as the bipolar plates in cathode PEMFCs environment.",

The current density as a function of time at 0.6 VSCE is obtained. Fig. 3b show transient currents curves of solid solution and surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steels in cathode PEMFCs environment. The current densities of two stainless steels decrease rapidly in the beginning, which indicates the formation of protective passive films on the surface of the two stainless steels in cathode PEMFCs environment. Then, the current increases and gradually stabilizes. It can be seen that surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel has evident lower steady current density than solid solution one in cathode PEMFCs environment, which is agreed with results from potentiodynamic polarization curves.

The stability of the system of the EIS tests can be effectively evaluated by Kramers-Kronig (K-K) transforms which can be used to validate the data and examine the linearity, causality and stability constraints of the system based on Linear Systems Theory (LST) [18]. The transforming the real axis into the imaginary axis and the imaginary axis into the real axis was applied to the experimental impedance data by K-K transforms and experimental data. A good agreement between the impedance data and corresponding K-K transforms has be observed for surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel in inset in Fig. 4a. This indicates that the system satisfies the constraints of LST. One time constant is observed in Bode plots in Fig. 4b. In addition, surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel has higher phase angle than solid solution one, which indicates more compact passive film formed on surface molybdenumenriched 2205 duplex stainless steel in cathode PEMFCs environment. The higher molybdenum content and nitrogen content improved the corrosion resistance of the 2205 duplex stainless steel bipolar plates in cathode PEMFCs environment [19]. The above tests also indicate that surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel is more suitable as the bipolar plates in cathode PEMFCs environment due to its excellent corrosion resistance.\nThe Mott-Schottky measurements were carried out to evaluate the semiconductor characteristic of the passive films.

Each plot reveals two straight regions with a positive and a negative slopes separated by a narrow potential plateau range. The negative slope under flatband potential demonstrates the behavior of the p -type semiconductor characteristic, while the positive slope above flatband potential shows the behavior of a n -type semiconductor characteristic. According to point defect model [22], predominant acceptor species are cation vacancies in passive films, while major donor species are oxygen vacancies and/or cation interstitials. The negative and positive slopes in Mott-Schottky plots indicate that the duplex structure of passive film is formed on the surface of 2205 duplex stainless steels [23,24]. The outer layer of the passive film could be enriched in Fe and Mo oxides, while inner layer of the passive film could be enriched in the Cr oxides [25]. The donor and\nFig. 5.

It is obvious that donor and acceptor concentrations decrease significantly due to surface enriched molybdenum, especially for acceptor density. Therefore, it can be predicted that decreased donor and acceptor concentrations improve corrosion resistance of surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel bipolar plates in the simulated cathodic PEMFCs environment [26].\nFig. 6a and b show the Mo XPS spectra of the passive films formed on solid solution and surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steels in cathode PEMFCs environment. The Mo 3d spectrum consists of three peaks which are designated as metal molybdenum, MoO3 and MoO2, respectively [27]. In addition, the Mo-oxide content increases on surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel. More molybdenum oxides in passive film could significantly improve the corrosion resistance of surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel bipolar plates in cathode PEMFCs environment.\nThe ICR of the solid solution and surface molybdenum-enriched 2205 duplex stainless steel bipolar plates and the carbon paper is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of compaction force from 50 to 500 N cm /C0 2 . The contact resistance reduces with the increasing of the compaction force [28]. This is attributed to an increase in effective contact area [29]. The surface roughness could affect also surface contact resistance. Rough surfaces resulted in small share of contact area, which thus induced a high ICR value [30]. It was found that the corrosion resistance and conductivity of plasma nitrided stainless steel as bipolar plates improved significantly\nFig. 7.
