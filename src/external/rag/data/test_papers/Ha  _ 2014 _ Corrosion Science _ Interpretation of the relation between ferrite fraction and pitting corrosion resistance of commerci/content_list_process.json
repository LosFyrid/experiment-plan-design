    "text": "Duplex stainless steel (DSS) is a family of stainless steels consisting of approximately equal volume of ferrite ( a ) and austenite ( c ) phases [1-5]. It is known that the DSS exhibits well-balanced characteristics of favorable mechanical strength of the a phase and the high corrosion resistance of the c phase [6]. Furthermore, the desirable properties can be attained at relatively lower cost than the commercial FeCrNi-based austenitic stainless steels [7]. Thus, demands for the DSSs have been continuously increased in various industrial fields such as marine construction, desalination and chemical industries [1-6].\nThe mechanical and corrosion properties of DSSs are directly related to the microstructure, particularly the phase balance which results in the partition of alloying elements [3,6,8-10]. On various DSSs, many efforts have been made to find the optimum phase balance for the highest resistance against pitting corrosion [5,6,9,1113]. Garfias-Mesias et al. [9] investigated the pitting corrosion resistance of UNS S32550 (26Cr-5.9Ni-3.2Mo-1.0Mn-0.2 N-1.6CuFebalance) alloy consisting of 47-64 vol% of a phase by measuring critical pitting temperature (CPT) and pitting potential ( E pit), and they concluded that the resistance to the pitting corrosion gradually decreased as increase in the a fraction.

    "text": "The relation among pitting corrosion resistance, galvanic corrosion rate and phase fraction (44-63 vol% of ferrite phase) of UNS S32205/S31803 duplex stainless steel was investigated. The highest pitting potential was observed in the sample comprising 57 vol% of ferrite, and it decreased with increase in the phase imbalance. In the sample with 57 vol% ferrite fraction, the lowest galvanic corrosion rate between the ferrite and austenite phases was observed. It was found that the pitting corrosion resistance of the alloy samples comprising various ferrite fractions was primarily determined by the galvanic corrosion resistance between the two constituent phases.\n/C211 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n2.37Mo-2.88 W-0.35 N-Febalance DSS whose a fraction was controlled to be 50-53 vol%, and they reported that the samples with the a fraction of approximately 51 vol% exhibited the highest pitting corrosion resistance. Tan et al. [11] carried out the similar experimentsonUNSS32750(25.2Cr-6.7 Ni-3.4Mo-0.7Mn-0.27 N-Febalance) alloy whose a fraction was changed from 44 to 62 vol%. The CPT measurement on the alloy samples revealed that the sample comprising 49 vol% a fraction exhibited the highest pitting corrosion resistance. In addition, Zhang et al. [5] investigated UNS S31803 (22.4Cr-5.7Ni-3.0Mo-1.5Mn-0.17N-Febalance) weld metal with the a fraction of 53.6-62.5 vol%, and they reported that the highest pitting corrosion resistance was observed in the weld metal comprising 53.6 vol% of a phase. Recently, Yang et al. [12] investigated UNS S82441 (24.0Cr-3.4Ni-1.5Mo-3.0Mn-0.23 N-Febalance) alloy with various a fractions of 48-66 vol%. As a result, they observed that the sample with the a fraction of 48 vol% showed the highest pitting corrosion resistance, and it gradually decreased as the a fraction increased. In these papers, it was noted that the phase fraction ( a : c ) which exhibited the highest resistance to pitting corrosion was approximately 50:50, and the pitting corrosion resistance generally decreased with a rise in the phase imbalance in all the DSSs, though the investigated DSSs were different.\nAlso notable is that the previous reports summarized above focused on the pitting resistance equivalent numbers (PRENs) of the a and the c phases in the DSSs (PREN a and PREN c , respectively), to explain the relation between the resistance to pitting corrosion and the phase fraction [5,6,9,11-13].

    "text": "measure of the resistance to the pitting corrosion of stainless steels, which is useful to predict the relative pitting susceptibility. The PREN is a function of the alloying elements which influence the pitting corrosion resistance, those are Cr, Mo, W, Mn, and N. Among the elements, Cr, Mo, and W are the a phase stabilizers, and Mn and N are those for the c phase. The a and the c phases are enriched with their stabilizers, respectively, thus the PREN values of the two constituent phases become different. In addition, the change in the volume fractions of the constituent phases determines enrichment and/or dilution of their stabilizers. Therefore, the phase fraction, partitioning of the alloy elements, and hence the PREN value of each phase are closely correlated with each other.\nMost of the researchers [5,6,11-13] explained that the overall resistance to the pitting corrosion of the investigated DSS was determined by the pitting susceptibility level of less resistant phase than the other, which was predicted by the PREN values of the two phases. In addition, the experimental evidences supported that the highest pitting corrosion resistance was achieved in the annealed sample which exhibited the lowest difference in the PREN values between the a and c , D |PREN a -PREN c | were provided.\nStill there are some remained questions. First, the theory that the overall resistance to pitting corrosion of DSS is governed by the less resistant phase between the a and c is not always valid. For example, the pitting corrosion resistance level of UNS S32550 was not determined by the a phase with lower PREN than the c [9]. Furthermore, the previous papers used different PREN formulae. The PREN for stainless steel is generally expressed as PREN = [Cr]+3.3[Mo]+ x [N], where the [alloying element] is a concentration of the element in wt%. The x , the [N]'s coefficient is varied from 16 to 30. In the previous papers, it was found that 16 [9], 20 [5,11] and 30 [6,12] were used for the [N]'s coefficient. When the coefficient x is changed, the optimum phase ratio having the lowest D |PREN a -PREN c | value will be changed, and then the proposed relation between the measured pitting corrosion resistance and the expected resistance level become invalid.\nBased on the brief review, it can be concluded that the relation between the phase fraction and the pitting corrosion resistance of duplex stainless steels is not clarified yet. Thus, in this paper, the pitting corrosion resistance of commercial UNS S31803 (or UNS S32205) DSS consisting of the a phase of 44-63 vol% was investigated, and the relation between the pitting corrosion resistance and the phase fraction was discussed.",

    "text": "Pitting corrosion resistance of the annealed samples was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization tests in 4 M NaCl and 3.5 M KCl solutions at 70 /C176 C at a scan rate of 1 mV s /C0 1 . For the tests, a conventional three-electrode cell of 1 L comprising a working electrode (sample), a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a Pt plate counter electrode was used, and the tests were conducted using a potentiostat (Reference 600, GAMRY). For the working electrode, the annealed specimens were mounted in cold epoxy resin, and then mechanically ground using SiC papers up to 2000 grit and washed using distilled water. The polarization tests were conducted on the exposed area of 0.13 cm 2 , which was controlled using electroplating tape. The resistance to the pitting corrosion of the samples was evaluated by the E pit levels measured from the polarization curves. The E pit was determined as the potential at which a stable pitting corrosion occurs, that is, the potential point where a permanent increase in the anodic current density from the passive current density level is observed [14]. The initiation site for the pitting corrosion was observed using the SEM. For this, the alloy samples were polished to 1 l musing a diamond suspension, and potentiostatic tests was conducted on the samples (exposed area = 0.13 cm 2 ) in 4 M NaCl + 0.001 M HCl solution at 60 /C176 C under applying 0 V SCE. The acidified chloride solution rather than the neutral chloride solution was used to make it possible to observe the phase boundary and the initiation sites for the pitting corrosion simultaneously. Then, the resistance to galvanic corrosion between the a and c phases in each annealed sample was investigated. For this, the mounted samples polished to 1 l mwere immersed in 4 M NaCl + 0.01 M HCl at 60 /C176 C for 7 h. After the immersion test, corroded topography and three-dimensional roughness were investigated using the SEM and a surface optical profiler (Wyko NT8000, Veeco [15]). The polarization tests and the immersion test were conducted at least five times and three times, respectively, and good reproducibility was confirmed.",

From SEM images taken at a low magnification (Fig. 3(a)-(c)), it is confirmed that the nonmetallic inclusion containing S was not observed due to the extremely low S content of this alloy. Instead, only a few inclusions were observed, which were revealed to be (Mn, Cr)-oxides, and the numbers and distribution of the inclusions were similar in all the annealed samples. In addition, the SEM images taken at a high magnification (Fig. 3(a 0 )-(c 0 )) show that carbides and/or nitrides were not precipitated during the annealing.\nAs the annealing temperature was elevated, the a fraction and the average grain size increased. The phase fraction was quantified by image analyzing on the representative 5 optical micrographs.

The passive current density ( i passive) levels of the samples were in a range of 3.4-3.6 l A cm /C0 2 (at /C0 0.1 V SCE). The E corr and the i passive levels showed no dependency on the a fraction. The effect of the a fraction was observed in the E pit levels of the samples. As the a fraction increased from 44 to 57 vol%, the E pit level gradually increased from 0.259 to 0.433 V SCE. However, the significant decrease in the E pit level to 0.265 V SCE was observed in the sample with the largest a fraction of 63 vol% (Fig. 6(e)). Similar result was obtained in the 3.5 M KCl solution at 70 /C176 C (Fig. 6(a 0 )-(f 0 )). In this condition, all the samples also showed passivity at their E corr level of approximately /C0 0.24 V SCE, and the i passive levels of the samples were in a range of 3.7-4.0 l A cm /C0 2 (at /C0 0.1 V SCE). The E pit level measured in this solution increased from 0.157 V SCE (44 vol% a fraction, Fig. 6(a 0 )) to the highest value of 0.544 V SCE (57 vol% a fraction, Fig. 6(d 0 )), while the sample comprising 63 vol% of a phase showed the decreased E pit level of 0.309 V SCE (Fig. 6(e 0 )). The measured E pit levels were plotted as a function of the a fraction in Fig. 6(f) and (f 0 ) for each condition, respectively. The curves exhibit an inverted V-shape, and the highest E pit level were measured in the sample comprising 57 vol% of a phase.\nThe initiation sites for the pitting corrosion were investigated. The pitting corrosion was induced by a potentiostatic test in 4 M NaCl + 0.001 M HCl solution at 60 /C176 C under applying 0 V SCE, which was in the passive potential range. Fig. 7(a)-(c) present the representative corrosion morphology of the samples comprising the a fraction of 44, 50 and 63 vol%, respectively. In all the annealed samples regardless of the a fraction, it was observed that the pitting corrosion occurred mostly at the a phase adjacent to the c phase and propagated into the a phase. The phases shown in Fig. 7 were identified by composition analysis using the EPMA. Fig. 7 also informs that the galvanic corrosion occurs between the two phases in all the samples, and it is noted that the a phase is the less noble phase than the c phase in the annealed DSS2205 samples.",

The notable point in Fig. 8(a)-(e) is that the samples exhibit the difference in the corrosion depths.\nThe 3-dimensional shapes of corroded surfaces were investigated using the surface optical profiler, and hence the corrosion depth could be quantified from the corrosion topographs in Fig. 9. As mentioned above, the selectively corroded phase was the a phase in all the annealed samples. In addition, the corrosion depth of the a phase relative to the c phase's surface reflected the relative corrosion rate of the a phase, i.e., the galvanic corrosion rate. Thus, the corrosion depth was plotted as a function of the a fraction in Fig. 9(f). As the a fraction increased from 44 to 57 vol%, the average corrosion depth decreased from 2.006 to 0.897 l m. However, the average corrosion depth increased to 1.362 l m in the sample comprising 63 vol% of a phase. Thus, the corrosion depth versus the a fraction showed the V-shaped curve.",

    "text": "As discussed in the introduction section, most of the previous researchers explained the overall pitting corrosion resistance of duplex stainless steels with the PREN values of the two constituent phases. Thus, in this paper, the PREN values of the a and the c phases of each DSS2205 sample were calculated based on the chemical composition analysis results (Table 1). The PREN for the a phase (PREN a ) was calculating using the following formula [17];\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nFor the c phase, the generally accepted PREN formulae are as follows;\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nIn the PREN formulae for the c phase, the widely used [N]'s coefficients were 16 [4,9,22,23] or 30 [6,13,17,20,24-27], and thus both PREN values for the c phase were considered in this paper. In addition, it is well-known that the solutionized Mn reduces the pitting corrosion resistance, thus the coefficient of Mn in the PREN formula is /C0 1 [13,26]. The calculated PREN values of the a and c phases against the a fraction are plotted in Fig. 10. As the a fraction increased, the PREN a decreased linearly from 39.0 to 36.0, which was due to decrease in the Cr and Mo contents as the a fraction increased. On the other hand, the PREN c /C0 16 and PREN c /C0 30 gradually increased which was primarily caused by the concentrated N in the c phase along with the a fraction. The graphs for the PREN a and the PREN c /C0 16 versus the a fraction do not intersect at any point (Fig. 10(a)), while the graphs for the PREN a and the PREN c /C0 30 versus the a fraction have an intersection point at 50.8 vol% a fraction (Fig. 10(b)).\nFig. 6.

    "text": "As reviewed above, it has been considered that the overall resistance to the pitting corrosion of DSSs was governed by less resistant phase against pitting corrosion having the lower PREN value than the other. If this theory is valid, the overall pitting corrosion resistance of the DSS2205 alloy can be estimated by Fig. 10. Fig. 10(a) infers that the E pit levels of the annealed DSS2205 samples should gradually increase along with the a fraction, because the less resistant phase's PREN value (PREN c /C0 16) is linearly raised. However, the practical change in the E pit level along with the a fraction (Fig. 6(f) and (f 0 )) showed very different aspect, that is, the inverted V-shape. On the other hand, in Fig. 10(b), the two lines of PRENs versus the a fraction cross at 50.8 vol% a fraction point, and thus it seems to correspond to the graph of E pit versus the a fraction (Fig. 6(f) and (f 0 )). However, it is difficult to conclude that a strong correlation exists between the measured pitting corrosion resistance (Fig. 6(f) and (f 0 )) and the change in the PREN values (Fig. 10(b)). The first disagreement is found in the a fraction point at which the highest pitting corrosion resistance is shown. The optimum a fraction for the highest pitting corrosion is estimated as 50.8 vol% by the PREN lines in Fig. 10(b), but the measured E pit levels in Fig. 6(f) and (f 0 ) shows that the best a fraction is 57 vol%. In addition, the more important point is the pitting corrosion initiation site. Based on Fig. 10(b), it is estimated that the pitting corrosion will be initiated at the c phase in the DSS2205\nsamples comprising the a phase smaller than 50.7 vol%, and the preferential sites for the pitting corrosion initiation will be changed to the a phase in the samples comprising the a phase larger than 50.7 vol%. However, Fig. 7 demonstrates that the preferential pitting corrosion site is always the a phase regardless of the a fraction, even in the samples consisting of less than the 50.8 vol% of a phase. This phenomenon was also found in the literature [9,12,28]. In UNS S82441 (24Cr-3.4Ni-1.5Mo-3Mn-0.23 N-Febalance) alloy, the pitting corrosion preferentially occurred in the a phase regardless of change in the a fraction from 48 to 66 vol% [12]. In addition, Garfias-Mesias et al. [9] also reported that the pitting corrosion was confined to the a phase in the UNS S32550 (26Cr-5.9Ni3.2Mo-1.0Mn-0.2 N-1.6Cu-Febalance) comprising 47-64 vol% of a phase. For these reasons, it is concluded that the overall pitting corrosion resistance of the annealed DSS2205 samples should not be estimated by the PREN values only.",

During the pit growth in Fe-based metals, the chloride solution inside the occluded pit become acidified due to the hydrolysis reaction [29,30]. Inside the pit, the bare surface of metal without the passive film is exposed to the acidified chloride solution, and then general corrosion of the matrix takes place. Thus the pitting propagation or growth rate is governed by the uniform dissolution rate of the matrix. The overall pitting corrosion resistance of the\nDSS2205 samples comprising the various a fractions is affected by the resistance to the pitting corrosion initiation and resistance to the pitting corrosion propagation as well. The former is determined by various factors, including the PREN level of each phase and the area which is susceptible to the pitting corrosion initiation (that is, the a phase fraction and the area fraction of the grain boundary). The latter is governed by the galvanic corrosion resistance in this case, that is the difference in the E corr levels and the area ratio between the two phases. It is conceivable that the pit embryos are more frequently formed in the phase with less PREN value, but the growth of the pits is more activated in the samples showing the higher galvanic corrosion rate. In addition, the E pit level measured from the polarization test is the potential point where the stable pit occurs. Thus, the change in the E pit levels ver-\nFig. 10.

The a phase was enriched with Cr and Mo, and the c phase was enriched with Ni, Mn and N, respectively. The Cr and Mo contents in the a phase were lowered as increase in the a fraction. In addition, both the Ni and Mn contents in the c phase slightly decreased while those in the a slightly increased. The N concentration in the c phase obviously increased with increase in the a fraction, while that in the a showed no notable change as the a fraction increased.\n- (2) The resistance to the pitting corrosion of the annealed DSS2205 samples was evaluated using a potentiodynamic polarization tests.
