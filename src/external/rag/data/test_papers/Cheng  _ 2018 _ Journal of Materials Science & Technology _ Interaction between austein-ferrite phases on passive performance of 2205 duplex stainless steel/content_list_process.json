    "text": "Duplex stainless steels (DSSs), known as a two-phase structure comprising island-like austenite ( 𝛄 -phase, fcc) and continuous ferrite matrix ( 𝛂 -phase, bcc) [1-4], possess excellent mechanical properties and high corrosion resistance, and thus are widely employed in various industrial fields, such as oil, chemical, petroleum (offshore), and electric power industries. The passive film on stainless steels, which is a key to the high corrosion resistance, is strongly influenced by alloy elements. Therefore, a heterogeneous passive film is formed on DSS, due to the different chemical compositions of two constituent phases. Especially, Cr and Mo are more enriched in 𝛂 -phase, while Ni and Mn are more partitioned in 𝛄 -phase [5-7]. Thus, the passive behavior of each phase of DSS is important, because the weaker phase shows the dominant effect on the overall corrosion behavior. Additionally, the interaction effect of these two phases of DSS on the whole passive performance is also worth of discussing, since DSS exhibits greater corrosion resistance than conventional singlephase stainless steels, such as ferrite and austenitic stainless steels, in chloride-rich media [8,9].\n∗ Corresponding authors.",

Various electrochemical methods, such as OCP (open circuit potential), potentiodynamic curves, EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and Mott-Schottky plots, were employed in the study. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectrometer) and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) together with EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy) were also used for compositional analysis.

The working electrodes were initially reduced potentiostatically at -1.0 V vs SCE for 20 min to remove air-formed oxides, and then OCP curves were recorded for 30 min. EIS tests were obtained with the frequency from 100 kHz to 10 mHz. 10 mV was chosen as the peak to peak amplitude. To interpret the EIS data on the basis of equivalent electric circuits, ZSimpWin software was used. Moreover, the potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out at a potential scan rate of 0.1667 mV/s from -0.6 V vs SCE until anodic current density reached 1 mA/cm 2 . Measurements of capacitance were performed on films of specimens with the frequency of 1 kHz from -0.6 V vs SCE to 1.0 V vs SCE. Similarly, the peak to peak amplitude single was 10 mV, and the scan rate was 45 mV/s. Sufficient short testing time ensured the stability of passive films during the test while the capacitance was measured as a function of potential.\nThe localized electrochemical measurements were performed through a PAR Model 370 scanning electrochemical workstation, which was composed of a 370 scanning control unit, a M236A potentiostat, a M5210 lock-in amplifier, and a video camera system. The 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was used as test solution. A singlephase 𝛂 sample and a single-phase 𝛄 sample were prepared by the selective dissolution technique.

The micrograph of 2205 DSS after solution heat treatment at 1100 ◦ C for 30 min is examined by optical microscopy (Fig. 2). Etched by aquaregia reagent, dark region of microstructure is ferrite ( 𝛂 -phase), while white region is austenite ( 𝛄 -phase), and the surface area ratio of 𝛂 / 𝛄 is about 56/44.\nFig. 3 shows the SEM and MFM morphologies of the samples after potentiostatic etching.

The MFM morphologies of two single-phase samples are presented in Fig. 3(c) and (d). It is evident that the only phase exposed on the surface of 𝛄 -phase and 𝛂 -phase samples is paramagnetic 𝛄 -phase and ferromagnetic 𝛂 -phase, respectively, while the cavities are filled with epoxy resin. Therefore, it can be claimed that single-phase samples are well prepared.\nIt is obviously seen that potentiostatic etching can lead to selective dissolution of specific phase, leaving another phase almost not affected and resulting in the formation of cavities and convex. In order to identify the compositions of single 𝛂 -phase and 𝛄 -phase, EDS serves to analyze the major alloying elements, such as Fe, Cr, Mo, Ni and Mn. The elements concentrations of phase almost unaffected taken at least ten points averaged are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the amount of Si, Cr and Mo was more in 𝛂 -phase than that in 𝛄 -phase, while the amount of Ni was vice versa. Similarly, it can be demonstrated again that the surface area ratio of 𝛂 / 𝛄 is about 56/44.\n3.2. Interaction of ˛ / /CR phases on the electrochemical behavior of 2205 DSS",

Fig. 4 shows the quasi-steady polarization curves of dual-phase, 𝛄 -phase and 𝛂 -phase electrodes in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, marked with three different passive zones.

Although there is no distinct difference between the passive current density of 𝛄 -phase ( i /CR p ) and 𝛂 -phase ( i ˛ p ), i /CR p is clearly lower than i ˛ p in the relatively higher potential region ( E > E A), revealing that 𝛄 -phase's passive film is more stable than 𝛂 -phase. However, the passive current density of 2205 DSS sample ( i 2205 p ) is much more lower about one order of mag-\nFig. 5.

When E b > E > E B ( E B = 0.69 VSCE, indicated in Fig. 4), i 2205 p remains the lowest value, while i /CR p and i ˛ p begin to grow rapidly. When the potential reaches E b , i 2205 p is still lower over one order of magnitude than i /CR p and i ˛ p , even though E b of the three samples are nearly identical. It indicates that the chemical stability of the passive film on dual-phase sample is much better than that of the other single-phase samples.

    "text": "Fig. 5(a) shows the OCP curves of the three specimens in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution for 1800s. It can be seen that the potentials increase rapidly at the beginning, and then reach a steady value.The OCP values of dual-phase and 𝛄 -phase samples are similar, but higher than that of 𝛂 -phase sample. Fig. 5(b) is the complement of Fig. 5(a), which shows the potential increase rate of the three samples at the first 240 s of the OCP tests. Generally, the slope change of OCP curves is related to the growth process of passive film. Initially, the potential increase rate of 𝛂 -phase is higher than that of 𝛄 -phase (Fig. 5(b)), which is due to the higher content of Cr in 𝛂 -phase because Cr could benefit the re-passivation performance [18,19]. But later (the time interval from 240 s to the steady sate), the potential increase rate of 𝛄 -phase is beyond that of 𝛂 -phase, which could be attributed to the beneficial effect of Ni [20,21]. At these two regions, 2205 DSS sample possesses the highest potential increase rate, which shows a good accordance with the results of quasisteady polarization tests. In other word, the interaction of 𝛂 and 𝛄 in 2205 DSS favors the formation of passive film.\nEIS is employed to characterize the properties of the passive film. Firstly, Kramers-Kronig transform is used to validate the EIS test for the electrochemical system [22-24]. The testing system is stable and thus the data is reasonable. Fig. 6(a) is the result of Kramers-Kronig transform on the Bode plots of three samples in 3.5% NaCl solution with the immersion time of 12 h under OCP condition, indicating that the testing system is stable and the obtained EIS data are valid. It is clearly seen that the Bode plots of all the three specimens display 2 time constants, corresponding to 2 different main electrode reactions during passivation. It can also be seen that | Z | value of 2205 sample is markedly higher than that of the two single-phase samples, while these single-phase samples show similar responses to frequency signals. It indicates that the main reactions of 𝛄 -phase and 𝛂 -phase electrodes under the passive state would be similar, which are commonly recognized as the charge transfer process of the double layer and passivation process within the passive film [25]. But their combination, that is, the interaction of 𝛂 and 𝛄 will greatly influence the passivation process and the property of passive film. Fig. 6(b) is the Nyquist plots of the three samples. In agreement with the results in Fig. 6(a), the plots of two single-phase specimens are similar and both show significant difference with that of dual-phase sample.\nDifferent electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) models have been used for the interpretation of EIS plots on stainless steel surface [4,5,26,27]. In the present work, the EEC shown in Fig. 6(b) is chosen to fit the experimental data because the three samples do not undergo pitting corrosion and thus possess intact passive films, with solution resistance R s , charge transfer resistance of the double layer R t or outer passive layer resistance R outer in parallel with the related constant phase element CPE1, passive layer assistance R p and inner passive layer resistance R inner in parallel with the related CPE 2 [28,29]. CPE is widely used to replace the pure capacitance element C to reflect the capacitance behavior in terms of the dispersion effect. Its admittance Y is given by the following equation [30,31]:",

However, because the n 1 value of 2205 sample is around 0.94 and R outer value is much larger than R t , the time constant ( R outer and CPE1) should not be associated with the reaction occurring in the double layer, but the passive process in the outer layer of the passive film. In addition, although the middle-frequency time constant in the EIS plots of 2205 sample is attributed to the reaction in the outer part of the passive film, it does not mean that the charge transfer process in the double layer does not happen, but just that the much smaller signal of charge transfer process was covered by the response of passive process in the outer layer of the passive film. Moreover, it is clearly seen that the passive ability of 2205 DSS sample is greatly better than each of the single phases by comparing the values of R p and R inner . The passive film of 𝛄 -phase is more stable than that of 𝛂 -phase, which is in agreement with the results discussed above.\nIn order to further ascertain the interaction between 𝛂 and 𝛄 on the passive behavior, LEIS measurement was performed on the sample prepared as Fig. 1. Fig. 7 shows the result of the LEIS mea-\nFig. 7. LEIS result of the two-phase-coupled specimen in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution.\nFig. 8.

It can be seen that there exists two impendence value (| Z |) terraces far from the borderline between 𝛂 and 𝛄 phases. The higher | Z | terrace, which corresponds to 𝛄 phase, is about 9000-10000 /DEL , while the lower | Z | terrace, which corresponds to 𝛂 phase, is just about 7500 /DEL . The higher the | Z | is, the better the corrosion resistance of the passive film is, indicating that the passive film of 𝛄 -phase is more corrosion resistant than that of 𝛂 -phase. Moreover, a distinguishing transition region with a width of 700 𝛍 m can be observed near the borderline, which decreases from the 𝛄 -phase zone to 𝛂 -phase. On the base of our previous results, it is anticipated that a | Z | peak would appear around the borderline, which would correspond to the interaction of 𝛂 / 𝛄 . Or, there would be a minimum value between the two | Z | terraces, similar to the result of the document [32], which investigated galvanic coupling between carbon steel and zinc by LEIS and found a minimum in the vicinity of the interfacial zone because of the strong galvanic effect. However, both cases did not occur. A further SVME measurement on such sample also presents the same phenomenon (Fig. 8).\nThe above results indicate that there exists appreciable electrochemical difference between 𝛂 and 𝛄 , and then galvanic effect will occur near their interface. However, the case similar to the document [32] did not occur, indicating that the galvanic effect would not cause the local deterioration of the more active 𝛂 phase. In virtually the galvanic effect enhances the passive film on 𝛂 phase (The | Z | increases and the I decrease on the 𝛂 side near the borderline). That no | Z | peak is observed can be attributed to the sphere of the galvanic effect. When 𝛂 and 𝛄 are macro-scale connected (just like",

While 𝛂 and 𝛄 phases distribute lamellarly and finely (like DSS 2205), the interaction of 𝛂 / 𝛄 would be appreciable. The mechanism may be similar to the document [33]. Under the galvanic effect, the diffusion of the dissolved Ni, Cr or Mo cations would be promoted in a short distance between 𝛂 and 𝛄 zones, leading to the stability enhancement of the passive film.

Mott-Schottky approach is based on the Mott-Schottky relation, which describes the potential dependence on the space charge capacity, C , when a semiconductor electrode is under depletion condition\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere the positive sign is for n-type and the negative sign for p-type conductivity, N is charge carrier density, N D and N A represent the donor or acceptor density, e is the electron charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor, 15.6 as in the literature, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity with the value of 8.85 × 10 -14 F/cm, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10 -23 J/K), T is the absolute temperature, E is the applied electrode potential and E FB is the flat-band potential.\nFig. 9 shows the Mott-Schottky curves in the potential range from -0.5 to 0.4 V for the samples, in which a linear relationship\nTable 3 Calculated values of N D and E FB of films formed on 𝛂 -phase, 𝛄 -phase and dual-phase.\n\n𝛂 -phase, N D (10 20 cm - 3 ) = 25.9. 𝛂 -phase, E FB (V SCE ) = - 0.569. 𝛂 -phase, R 2 (%) = 97.8. 𝛄 -phase, N D (10 20 cm - 3 ) = 19.3. 𝛄 -phase, E FB (V SCE ) = - 0.515. 𝛄 -phase, R 2 (%) = 99.8. dual-phase, N D (10 20 cm - 3 ) = 6.2. dual-phase, E FB (V SCE ) = - 0.570. dual-phase, R 2 (%) = 98.9\ncan be observed and an n-type semiconductor behavior for all three samples' passive films can be determined.

    "text": "Obviously, the N D values are ranked as dual-phase sample < 𝛄 -phase < 𝛂 -phase. According to point defect model (PDM) [34-36], N D can be an indicator of cation vacancy density originated from dissolving of cations at the interface of passive film/solution, whose magnitude and migration determine the growth and breakdown of the passive layer. Therefore, the lower N D value indicates the lower dissolving rate of the cations at the interface of passive film/solution, that is, the better the chemical stability of the passive film. Therefore, the chemical stabilities of the films on these three samples are in the order as follows: dual-phase sample > 𝛄 -phase > 𝛂 -phase. Apparently, the interaction of 𝛂 / 𝛄 phases decreases the dissolving rate of cations in the film and enhances the chemical stability of the passive film.\nTable 4 Binding energies E be of XPS-peaks of\nstandards.\nFe 2p 3/2, 1 = Peak E be /eV.

OH -is the primary constituent of the films formed in the air, which relates to the formation of Cr(OH)3 and FeOOH while O 2 -is the primary constituent of Cr2O3, Fe2O3 and FeO.

Similarly, the film formed on 𝛂 -phase reveals the presence of Cr2O3, and Cr(OH)3, respectively. The contents of Cr and its compounds determined from XPS are listed in Table 5.\nThe films on two single phases have similar chemical composition, corresponding to their corrosion resistance. And yet, it is worth noting that the Cr(OH)3 is not detected in film formed at 2205 DSS, Cr2O3 maybe the single species and the intensity of the Cr2O3 states are apparently higher than those formed at 𝛂 -phase or 𝛄 -phase, and the content of Cr2O3 in passive film of 𝛂 -phase was higher than that of 𝛄 -phase.",

    "text": "Generally, chromium in the oxide layer plays important roles in electronic properties and corrosion resistance of films. A heterogeneous passive film was formed on duplex stainless steel due to the differences in chemical composition between 𝛄 -phase and 𝛂 -phase [39]. From the published document [40], Cr2O3 is an intermediate oxide, which is the most stable solid chromium and has the properties between network forming (Cr O Cr) and modifying oxide, compared with the hydroxides Cr(OH)2, Cr(OH)3, and the oxides CrO2, and CrO3. And an increase of hydroxides in the passive film also exhibited harmful effects on the corrosion resistance of stainless steel [41-43]. Therefore, it is the critical factor to the chemical stability of passive film. And the passive film would possess different N D. In extreme situation when potential reaches transpassive region most Cr 3+ is incorporated as Cr 6+ in the passive film and the oxycompound dissolves faster in acidic solutions [44,45].\nThe current result indicates that the interaction between 𝛂 and 𝛄 increases the amount of Cr2O3 in the passive film, leading to the decrease of the dissolved cations from the passive film, that is, leading to the decrease of N D. With the modification of chemical composition and semiconduct property of the passive film, the corrosion resistance of 2205 DSS is appreciably enhanced comparing with the single phases. Although there exists potential difference between 𝛄 -phase and 𝛂 -phase, galvanic effect between 𝛂 and 𝛄 phases cannot deteriorate local corrosion, and it may promote the diffusion of the passive cations in short distance and be beneficial to the passive behavior of 2205 duplex stainless steel [46]. Some indirect evidences have been reported that acicular phases [47] or refined grains [46] of duplex stainless steel could improve the chromium diffusion and promote the formation of compact passive film. This may involve the relationship between the galvanic effect and the geometry of the phases or grains. The more refinement the grains or phases, the more significant the galvanic effect between 𝛂 and 𝛄 , and then the more significant the modification on the passive film. It gives us a clue that further refining 𝛂 / 𝛄 size would greatly enhance the corrosion resistance of 2205 DSS. We will present such work shortly afterward.",

Under the galvanic effect, the diffusion of dissolved passive cations would be promoted in a short distance between 𝛂 and 𝛄 zones, leading to modifications of chemical composition and semiconductive property of the passive film and therefore the enhancement of the corrosion resistance of DSS 2205. This indicates that further refining 𝛂 and 𝛄 phases would markedly enhance the passive film on DSS 2205.",
