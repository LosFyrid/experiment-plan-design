    "text": "Duplex  stainless  steels,  DSS,  are  a  group  of  stainless  steels  with  a  microstructure  of  almost  equal  amount  of austenite  and  ferrite.  These  materials  show  an  attractive  combination  of  excellent  corrosion  resistance  and  high mechanical properties  comparing with  either  austenitic  stainless  steels  or  ferritic  stainless  steels,  especially  super duplex stainless steels, Charles (1991) and Nilsson and Chai (2011). They have been widely used oil-gas industry, Kangas and Chai (2016). Due to its high ratio of property to cost,  super duplex  stainless  steels  have  become  an alternative to other higher performance materials such as super austenitic stainless steels and Ni-based alloys, and have had a about 20 years' very successful applications or  experiences  in  the  oil-gas  industry,  Kangas  and  Chai (2016). With the exploration of the deeper wells, the wall thickness of tube material used may need to increase and the material may also need coating for added corrosion protection. The problem is that the increase in wall thickness will  also  increases  the  stress  in  the  material  due  to  its  own  weight.  Once  it  reaches  its  allowable  stress,  no  more length  can  be  increased.  Another  problem  is  that  increase  in  wall  thickness  can  also  increase  the  costs  for  the installation. This clearly shows the desires for new alloys with even higher high strength than those of the existing super-duplex  stainless  steels.  In  the  other  areas,  new  high  alloyed  duplex  stainless  steels  with  a  combination  of excellent  corrosion  resistance  and  higher  high  strength  are  needed.  For  these  challenges,  two  new  high  alloyed duplex  stainless  steels,  Sandvik  SAF  2707HD  and  Sandvik  SAF  3207HD,  have  recently  been  developed.  The nitrogen contents in these alloys is now up to about 0.5%. They have PRE-values close to 50 without sacrificing the fabricability, and are now designated as hyper duplex stainless steel, HDSS. These new alloys show both highest corrosion pitting resistance or highest CPT and highest strength among the existing modern DSS, Chai and Kangas (2011).  These  new  materials  has  a  yield  strength  20%  higher  than  that  of  the  super  duplex  stainless  steel  and  a service  temperature  up  to  90°C.  The  benefits  when  it  comes  to  building  umbilicals  and  control  flowlines  are considerable. Thinner walls and lighter installations make it possible to reach and operate ultra-deep wells that were previously too costly or too complex to exploit. At the same time, the temperature and pressure window widens. This paper  will  provide  an  overview  on  super  and  hyper  duplex  stainless  steels,  microstructure,  properties  and applications.",

Addition  of  Mo  is  mainly  to  improve  corrosion  resistance,  but  also  increase  the strength. Addition of N is mainly to increase strength but also improve structure stability and corrosion resistance. PRE is the pitting corrosion resistance equivalent value of an alloy. This value is believed to be proportional to the pitting  corrosion  resistance  of  a  duplex  stainless  steel.  The  material  with  a  higher  PRE  value  may  show  a  better corrosion resistance. PRE value is defined to be calculated as Equation 1.\nTable 1.

Sandvik SAF 2707HD has a minimum PRE value of 50 and Sandvik SAF 3207HD has a minimum PRE value of 48, comparing with 42.5 on Sandvik SAF 2507. A duplex stainless steel with a PRE value above 48 is nowadays\ndesignated  as  hyper  duplex  stainless  steel,  HDSS,  Göransson  (2006),  Chai  (2009)  and  (2011).  Duplex  stainless steels Sandvik SAF 2707HD and Sandvik SAF 3207HD are therefore hyper duplex stainless steels.\nThe challenge to develop highly alloyed duplex stainless steels is to control the risk for formation of intermetallic phase  by  increasing  content  of  elements  such  as  Cr  and  Mo  or  N.  With  modern  thermodynamic  simulation  and calculation, however, some unexpected positive synergistic effects of addition of the elements Cr, Mo and N to high levels  have  been  observed.  Actually,  Sandvik  SAF  2507  is  the  first  duplex  stainless  steel  developed  by  the thermodynamic simulation, Nilsson (1992).

They are heterogeneous in different directions. In the longitudinal direction, the austenitic phase is elongated (Fig. 3a). In the transversal direction, the austenitic phase is isolated by the matrix: ferritic phase (Fig. 3b).  These  type  of  microstructures  are  normally  used  to  describe  the  grain  structure  of  duplex  stainless  steels. Actually, it is not true. Fig. 3c and d show the grain structures of the austenitic and ferritic phases in this material. The grain sizes of both phases are very small. The austentic grains are generally randomly distributed (Fig. 3c). The ferritic grain are however rather oriented, mainly toward [111].  It was also found that austenitic phase contains large amount of twins with mainly Σ3 twin boundaries. Actually, the twin boundary in this material is so high that it is of up to 65% of total boundaries in the austenitic phase.  As expected, no or very few twin boundary could be found in the ferritic phase.\n(c)\n(b)\n(d)\nFig. 3.

The critical crevice corrosion temperature, CCT, was determined using the MTI-2 crevice former. The testing time for  both  CPT  and  CCT  tests  was  24  hours,  and  the  same  specimen  was  used  throughout  each  CPT/CCT\nmeasurement.  Fig  4a  shows  a  comparison  of  the  CPT  and  CCT  of  super  and  hyper  duplex  stainless  steels.  As expected, hyper duplex stainless steels show much higher both CPT and CCT than super duplex stainless steel. CCT improves from about 50°C of super DSS to about 70°C of hyper DSS. These two hyper DSS show similar CCT. CPT improves from about 80°C of super DSS to about 95°C of hyper DSS. SAF 3207HD has shown a CPT from 8593°C, Chai (2009). Fig. 4b shows a comparison CPT of austenitic stainless steels and duplex stainless steels and correlations between the PRE values and the CPT determined experimentally. Super or hyper duplex stainless steel can replace some super austenitic stainless steels. Recent G48C/G48D corrosion tests show that Alloy 625 and Alloy C-276 are susceptible to crevice corrosion at temperatures far below those of SAF 2707HD (Table 3). This indicates that SAF 2707HD can replace these alloys in some applications and is much more cost efficient (far less nickel).\nPRE-value\nFig. 4. (a) CCT and CPT of duplex stainless steels, (b).

    "text": "Since  austenitic  and  ferritic  phases  in  a  duplex  stainless  steel  have  different  mechanical  behaviors,  the  bulk mechanical behavior of a DSS material strongly depends on that of the individual phase. This can be expressed by equation 2\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nWhere  is the stress,  is the ferritic phase,  is the austenitic phase, V is the volume fraction of the contributing phases. Fig. 5 shows micro stress responses in a super duplex stainless steel during an in-situ tensile test in X-ray diffractometer and with a multiscale simulation. When a stress was applied the phase stresses responded differently (Fig. 5a). The stress in the ferrite increased much faster than that in the austenite. As a stress of 560 MPa was applied the  stresses  in  the  phases  became  almost  equal.  Beyond  this  point  the  stress  in  the  ferrite  began  to  decrease  and remained  at  a  level  of  approximately  500  MPa  till  the  loading  was  stopped.  Meanwhile  the  stress  in  austenite\nincreased rapidly and reached its limit at around 960 MPa at a strain of 14.1%. During the whole test the austenite took a higher load. The macro stress in the material could therefore be calculated using Equation 2. The simulation shows  the  similar  attendance,  where  the  austenitic  phase  will  yield  earlier  than  the  ferritic  phase.  However,  the austenitic phase has a higher deformation hardening rate.\nFig. 5.

Simulated stress versus strain curves in the individual phases in a super duplex stainless steel with 0.27%N and 50% volume of ferrite.\nAs  known,  a  duplex  stainless  steel  generally  shows  a  higher  strength  comparing  its  corresponding  single  phase austenitic  or  ferritic  stainless  steel,  Nilsson  and  Chai  (2011).  Fig.  6  shows  a  comparison  of  the  yield  strength  of austenitic and duplex stainless steels. SAF 3207HD has a strength that is more than three times as that of AISI 316La very commonly used austenitic stainless steels. As discussed above, high alloying elements and fine grain size in duplex stainless can be very important factors to the high strength of duplex stainless steels. As shown in Fig. 5a, however, the yield point of the austenitic phase is actually rather low in a duplex stainless steel. A coupling yielding effect of the austenitic and ferritic phases could be another important factor. However, this is less studied, Lillbacka (2007) and Jia (2006). Fig. 6b shows the influence of temperature on the 0.2% proof strength of the super and hyper duplex  stainless  steel  tube  materials  with  a  wall  thickness  of  up  to  4  mm.  Their  strengths  are  higher  than  the minimum yield strength as shown in Fig. 6a. The dimension of tube is also an important factor to the strength.\nFig. 6. (a)  Yield strength of austenitic and duplex stainless steels at RT, (b). Influence of temperature on the super and hyper duplex stainless tube materials.\nFor  some  subsea  applications,  dynamic  mechanical  properties  such  as  fatigue  strength  are  critical  to  some component such as umbilicals, Chai (2009). Fig. 7 shows a comparison of both high cycle fatigue (HCF) (Fig. 7a) and low cycle fatigue (LCF) (Fig. 7b) of the super and hyper duplex stainless steels. Since SAF 3207HD has much higher strength than SAF 2507 and their elongations are similar, Sandvik SAF 3207HD has a higher HCF life as",

For low cycle fatigue behavior, there is a transition point at about 1000 cycles. Below this number of cycle, SAF 2507 has a longer fatigue life, but Sandvik SAF 3207HD shows a higher fatigue life in the small strain range. This is due the fact that for HCF or longer fatigue life, the strength of the material is a critical factor. On the other hand or for low cycle fatigue, the fatigue life is controlled by the ductility of the material.\nFig. 7.

    "text": "Extremely  high  critical  pitting  temperature,  CPT,  and  critical  crevice  corrosion  temperature,  CCT,  of  hyper duplex stainless steels allow the materials to be used in the areas where high corrosion resistance and high service temperature are required. The good combination of extra high strength and high ductility makes it possible for hyper duplex  stainless  steels  to  allow  substantial  reduction  in  wall  thickness,  which  leads  to  a  reduction  of  weight  in applications  such  as  ultra-deep  seawater,  energy  and  refinery  sectors.  In  all  these  situations  the  alloy's  superior properties can be fully utilized to ensure reliability and safe service.  One example is subsea umbilicals, which are used as a connection between a platforms control station and the wellheads on the seabed to supply necessary control signals and to inject chemicals to subsea oil and gas wells. A stainless steel umbilical has an outer plastic sheeting with stainless steel tubes and cables (electric and others) inside. The umbilical tube materials are required to have excellent corrosion resistance and high fatigue properties. Super duplex stainless steel, Sandvik SAF 2507, has been the most common choice of material since it was introduced in 1993, Kangas and Chai (2016).\nToday the oil exploration strives to deeper waters, where the water depth is over 2500 meters or the pressure ratings are rising above 15000 psi. In some cases higher temperatures call for stronger and more corrosion resistant materials  than existing duplex and superduplex stainless steels that can handle reliably. Sandvik SAF 3207HD is suitable  for  deeper  wells  and  corrosive  conditions.  The  proof  strength  of  typical  umbilical  sizes  is  roughly  20% higher compared to the commonly used Sandvik SAF 2507, which means lower weight for long umbilicals and the ability to withstand higher external pressure in deep sea applications. Table 4 shows an example.\n8\nAuthor name / Structural Integrity Procedia  00 (2016) 000-000\nTable 4 Example for weight saving (1/2' ID (12.70 mm) 15000 psi)\n\nSandvik SAF 2507, ID.mm = 12.70.

Sandvik SAF 3207HD, weight save.% = 22\nAnother application of Sandvik SAF 3207HD is raw seawater injection where untreated seawater is injected into the well in order to replace the retrieved oil and hence increase the output from the well. The string shall support its own weight and threaded connections in combination with warm seawater which results in that very good crevice corrosion resistance in combination with high mechanical strength is of vital importance. Sandvik SAF 3207HD is an excellent solution for such application.",
