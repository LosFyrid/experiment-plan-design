    "text": "The effects of additive manufacturing (AM) and post-AM heat treatment on microstructural characteristics and pitting corrosion of 2205 duplex stainless steel were studied and benchmarked against its conventionally hot-rolled counterpart. The rapid solidification and possible loss of N associated with AM resulted in a non-equilibrium microstructure dominated by d -ferrite with a minor fraction of austenite and abundant Cr2N precipitation. Atom probe tomography revealed that no depletion of Cr occurs around intragranular Cr2N. A deduction in Cr was observed adjacent to intergranular Cr2N particles, however, Cr content in these regions remained above the critical value of 13 wt%. Post-AM heat treatment was effective in restoring the duplex microstructure while dissolving the Cr2N precipitates. Although the pitting resistance in the as-built AM specimen was lower than that of its hot-rolled counterpart, it was fully recovered after post-AM heat treatment.\n/C211 2021 The Author(s).

    "text": "Following the great progress in additive manufacturing (AM) during the past decades, many industry sectors now attempt to use this technology to enable the production of complex 3D\ngeometries in a single step while reducing lead time and cost [1,2]. Apart from design flexibility, AM has also unlocked new combinations of attractive material properties [3] such as mechanical [4-6] and corrosion [7-9] properties that are often not attainable through conventional manufacturing routes. These improvements can be related to the unique microstructural features in AM materials resulting from complex thermal histories (e.g., rapid cooling and cyclic reheating) during AM processing. These features include the grain morphology [10,11], grain boundary characteristics [12], local chemical compositions [13], and morphology of precipitates/ inclusions [14,15], to name just a few. All these features would influence the properties of AM materials in comparison to what is expected for their conventionally manufactured counterparts. Such differences between AM and conventionally manufactured materials necessitates thorough investigations and benchmarking of microstructure-property relationships.\nAmong various groups of metallic materials currently processed by AM, stainless steels have gained considerable attention due to their widespread applications in several industries, including biomedical, petrochemical, marine, oil & gas, and construction [16]. The majority of the available literature on AM stainless steels has focussed on austenitic and precipitation-hardening stainless steels, whose processing-microstructure-property relationships have been studied in several research and review papers, for instance in references [17,18]. However, duplex stainless steels (DSSs), as a group of important engineering materials especially suitable for applications such as pressure vessels, heat exchangers, and underwater infrastructure, have so far received less attention in the AM literature, particularly in terms of their corrosion behaviour. This could be partially related to the challenges associated with achieving a balanced duplex microstructure of roughly equal fractions of austenite and d -ferrite similar to that obtained in conventional manufacturing [3,19].\nDSSs are usually characterised by their balanced d -ferrite/ austenite microstructures, offering an excellent combination of corrosion resistance and mechanical properties, with both higher strength and toughness due to the presence of two equilibrium phases. However, previous studies have found that d -ferrite (referred to as ferrite in the following) is the major phase in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) duplex stainless steels in the as-built state [20-23]. This has been attributed to the high cooling rates inherent to LPBF processing which favour the formation of a dominantly ferritic microstructure via largely bypassing the austenite transformation nose. Typical austenite contents reported in the as-built condition of LPBF DSSs are less than 5%. However, a balanced microstructure could be restored (back to > 40% austenite) via an appropriate post-AM heat treatment [21,23,24]. This postprocessing heat treatment is therefore essential to restore the equilibrium duplex microstructure and mechanical properties of DSSs. In conventional manufacturing, post-fabrication annealing has commonly been applied to modify the microstructure, control the proportion of ferrite and austenite phases, redistribute alloying elements, and change the grain morphology with the aim of enhancing both the mechanical and corrosion properties of DSSs [25-27].",

    "text": "While there are some studies on the mechanical properties of AM DSSs in both as-built and post-AM heat treated conditions, the corrosion behaviour has received less attention so far, and results are ambiguous to some extent. Murkute et al. [28] reported a decrease in corrosion rate with an increased amount of austenite in heat-treated AM 2507 super duplex stainless steel, showing an indirect evidence of the positive influence of austenite on corrosion performance. In contrast, Jiang et al. [29] reported similar pitting and re-passivation potentials for as-built LPBF 2205 duplex and 2507 super duplex stainless steels compared to their heat-treated and conventional counterparts in sodium chloride solution at room temperature. Nevertheless, the processing-microstructure-corro sion relationships in LPBF DSSs are yet to be investigated in detail, especially at temperatures above room temperature, and after post-AM heat treatments. Critical pitting temperature (CPT) experiments have commonly been used as a criterion for determining the pitting susceptibility of conventional DSSs versus temperature [30,31], but this technique has not yet been applied to study AM DSSs.\nThe current study aims to fill these important knowledge gaps in understanding the pitting corrosion behaviour of DSSs. DSS 2205 samples were produced by LPBF and subsequently annealed. Polarisation measurements and CPT experiments were employed to investigate the pitting corrosion resistance in both as-built and heat-treated conditions. The corrosion behaviour of a benchmark hot-rolled DSS 2205 specimen was also investigated for comparison purposes. A range of microscopy analyses techniques from micron to atomic scale were carried out to understand the influence of microstructural characteristics on pitting corrosion.",

LPBF processing was performed using an SLM Solution 125 HL machine with a 400 W laser purged with Ar, and the processing parameters given in Table 1. These parameters are the optimised parameters to achieve a high density and avoid the formation of lack-of-fusion (LOF) pores. Cubes with an edge length of 15 mm were printed. The relative density of the as-built LPBF specimen was measured to be /C24 99.6%, according to the Archimedes principles using an Electronic Densimeter (Model SD200L) with a 0.1 mg/cm 3 resolution. Before density measurements, the specimen was ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol for 10 min to remove the residual powder attached to the surface from the LPBF processing.\nHalf of the as-built LBPF specimens were subjected to post-AM heat treatment at the temperature of 1000 /C176 C for 10 min followed by water quenching to room temperature. The temperature for annealing was selected based on the previous studies on the same steel to maximise austenite fraction [21] while avoiding formation of undesired Sigma phase [32]. For benchmarking purposes, a hotrolled 2205 DSS with the chemical composition of 0.036 C, 0.321Si, 1.82 Mn, 0.013 P, 23.2 Cr, 5.6 Ni, 2.90 Mo, 0.034 Co, 0.153 Cu, 0.245 N and the balance Fe (in wt%) received in the form of a plate with a thickness of 20 mm was also subjected to the same corrosion investigations.",

The austenite particles are in the shape of thin layers and are mostly spread along the ferrite/ferrite grain boundaries. Ferrite grains also show internal misorientation gradients, manifested by small changes in the inverse pole figure (IPF) colouring within ferrite grains. Such gradients are usually introduced as a result of solidification to accommodate strain gradients across a grain. The IPF map of the as-built specimen (Fig. 1b) shows ferrite grains with strong h 001 i orientation parallel to the build direction (BD), which resulted from the directional thermal gradients during the LPBF processing. Post-AM heat treatment is shown to promote austenite formation both intergranularly and intragranularly (Fig. 1c). During post-AM heat treatment, the austenite content increases to /C24 45%. Intragranular austenite particles have an average size of 2 m m. Interestingly, ferrite preserves its h 100 i //BD texture (Fig. 1d).

    "text": "Based on the Cr/Ni equivalent versus temperature phase diagram (Fig. 2) of steels [35], DSSs with a Creq/Nieq ratio above 1.95 solidify as 100% ferrite above the ferrite solvus line. Below this line, the ferrite to austenite transformation begins, whose nature depends on the chemical composition, ferrite grain size, and the cooling rate [36,37]. Under extremely rapid cooling conditions as observed during LPBF processing, the ferrite content in the solidified material remains high since the time required for ferrite to austenite transformation is insufficient [38]. Another factor that might affect the austenite fraction is the loss of the austenite stabiliser N during LPBF processing. It has been reported that during welding, the extremely high temperatures in the arc combined with pure argon as shielding gas may cause a loss of N from the melt pool [39]. A reduction in N content, in turn, is expected to lower the austenite content [40]. Upon post-AM heat treatment, alloying elements will readily diffuse. As a result, the transformation of ferrite to austenite (which was suppressed due to the fast cooling associated with LPBF processing) will take place quickly, resulting in further growth of existing austenite (mostly as austenite allotriomorphs), and parallel nucleation of new austenite grains on sub-grain boundaries, dislocations and nano-scale precipitates/particles.\nThe bright-field TEM image of the as-built LPBF specimen (Fig. 3a) shows a high density of dislocations, which is believed to be induced due to the high solidification rates and thermal stresses associated with LPBF processing [21]. A large number of small rod-shaped particles are observed to be precipitated in the as-built LPBF specimen within the ferrite grains, as depicted in the higher magnification STEM image in Fig. 3b. The associated EDS analysis in Fig. 3b reveals the enrichment of Cr and N in these secondary precipitates, indicating the formation of Cr-rich nitrides, identified as Cr2N. Most of these Cr2N particles are precipitated intragranularly inside the ferrite grains (see yellow arrows in Fig. 3b,c). In addition, some intergranular Cr2N can be observed along the ferrite grain boundaries, as shown in the STEM image in Fig. 3c (see blue arrows). The fast cooling inherent to LPBF results in a nonequilibrium ferritic microstructure supersaturated with N. Since\nFig. 2. The phase diagram of steels based on Creq/Nieq ratio. Replotted after [35].

All specimens exhibit a wide passive range and a passive current density of less than 1 l A/cm 2 , indicating the formation of a protective passive film on the surface. This film inhibits the materials from being corroded at high anodic potentials. At anodic potentials higher than 1 VAg/AgCl, the current density started to increase due to the breakdown of the passive film. The breakdown/pitting potentials acquired from these curves along with their standard deviations are presented in Fig. 5 for each specimen. As can be seen, the hot-rolled specimen exhibits the highest pitting potential of /C24 1.13 VAg/AgCl. The as-built LPBF specimen shows a lower pitting potential ( /C24 1.05 VAg/AgCl) compared to the hotrolled one, despite its ferritic microstructure with abundant Cr2N precipitates. Fig. 5 also shows that the heat-treated LPBF specimen has a pitting potential comparable to its hot-rolled counterpart (1.15 vs. 1.13 VAg/AgCl) and slightly higher than in the as-built LPBF specimen (1.15 vs. 1.05 VAg/AgCl). Therefore, the polarisation measurements at room temperature do not show any significant difference in pitting corrosion resistance between the as-built and heattreated LPBF 2205 DSS and their hot-rolled counterpart. Indeed, the finely dispersed Cr2N precipitates seem to not act as localised corrosion initiation sites at the testing conditions in this study, which is in excellent agreement with the findings of Bettini et al. [42] for the same grade of DSS in a similar solution. For the welded joints of DSSs and those exposed to post-manufacturing heat treatments at high temperatures (usually above 1100 /C176 C) where many Cr2N precipitates are formed upon cooling, it is generally known that the Cr-depleted regions around the Cr2N precipitates act as the corrosion initiation sites when exposed to aggressive environments. However, the susceptibility of Cr2N precipitates to localised corrosion initiation depends on their size, distribution and local chemical environment.",

Despite this reduction in Cr, the minimum Cr content was recorded to be 15.3 at.% (14.6 wt%). This means that no depletion of Cr to critical values below 13% (passivity level for stainless steels [43]) occurs at regions adjacent to the Cr2N precipitates, as shown in Fig. 6, which might be an explanation for why the pitting potential in the as-built LPBF specimen was not deteriorated compared to its hot-rolled counterpart despite the presence of Cr2N precipitates.\nFig. 3.

CPT was measured to be 61 ± 1 /C176 C for the hot-rolled specimen, which is in agreement with the literature for conventional 2205 DSS [44,45]. CPT decreased from 61 ± 1 /C176 C for the hot-rolled specimen to 47 ± 2 /C176 C for the as-built LPBF specimen, indicating a degradation in pitting corrosion resistance. This is an indication that the ferritic structure with numerous Cr2N precipitates in the as-built LPBF material is less resistant to pitting corrosion at higher temperatures. Such phenomenon has been commonly reported for the welded joints in DSSs [46] and annealed DSSs at high temperatures [47]. The heat-treated LPBF specimen showed an enhanced CPT value of 61 ± 1 /C176 C, which is similar to that of the hot-rolled specimen, suggesting the beneficial effects of short-time post-AM heat treatments in homogenising the microstructure and restoring the pitting corrosion resistance.\nA comparison of the results obtained from polarisation measurements at room temperature to the CPT measurements indicates the significant importance of exposure temperature on the pitting susceptibility in LPBF 2205 DSS. With respect to corrosion resistance, the ratio of austenite to ferrite phases plays a crucial role as the partitioning of corrosion-resistant elements (e.g., Cr,\nMo, and N) favours the galvanic corrosion between those phases and consequently affects the corrosion resistance of DSSs [48,49]. Such elemental distribution is strongly dependent on the manufacturing route and post-manufacturing thermal processing. This phenomenon has been extensively investigated for conventionally manufactured DSSs based on the criterion called pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN). It is believed that a phase with a lower PREN value determines the pitting susceptibility [26]. In this regard, different grades of DSSs with various ratios of ferrite to austenite have been investigated in the literature. It has been generally reported that the pitting corrosion resistance decreases with increasing the ferrite content in the alloy [50-52].\nThe PREN for ferrite and austenite phases in DSSs is calculated based on Eq. (1), revealing the strong dependence of pitting resistance on the content of major alloying elements of Cr, Mo, and N.\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nIn order to achieve better pitting corrosion resistance, both the austenite and ferrite phases must have PREN values that are high and close to each other.

The PREN values for ferrite and austenite phases in the as-built LPBF specimen are 28.38 and 41.08, respectively. The low PREN of the ferrite phase could be due to the fact that the as-built LPBF specimen is almost fully ferritic, and the ferrite-forming elements (i.e., Cr and Mo) are distributed over larger volumes of the ferrite phase, resulting in an overall decreased concentration of Cr and Mo in ferrite. This suggests a higher susceptibility of the ferrite phase to dissolution compared to the austenite phase at temperatures above CPT. The PREN values change after the post-AM heat treatment.

Backscattered SEM images of typical corrosion pits on corroded surfaces of (a) as-built LPBF, (b) heat-treated LPBF, and (c) hot-rolled 2205 DSS after CPT experiments in 1.0 M NaCl solution. Regions with bright and grey contrasts in (b) and (c) indicate austenite and ferrite phases, respectively. These have also been marked with A and F for austenite and ferrite, respectively. Arrows in c show the austenite/ferrite interface, where the pitting seems to be started and propagated towards the austenite phase. Note that the scale bars in images for different samples are different.\nThe results presented in this research lead to the conclusion that the post-AM heat treatment is an essential step for LPBF duplex stainless steels to restore the excellent pitting corrosion resistance at temperatures higher than room temperature through achieving a microstructure with balanced ferrite to austenite ratio, and free from Cr2N precipitates. This is in contrast with the previously-established phenomenon for the LPBF austenitic and precipitation-hardening stainless steels, where heat treatment has been identified as a non-necessary post-processing step for corrosion-related applications because it deteriorates the excellent pitting corrosion resistance in the as-built conditions mainly due to the re-appearance/coarsening of detrimental inclusions [5557]. In a nutshell, post-AM heat treatment has a complex influence on the properties of the AM stainless steels depending on the initial microstructure and the desired properties for the intended applications, which requires to be studied in a case-by-case manner.",

    "text": "The effects of additive manufacturing and post-AM heat treatment on the pitting corrosion resistance and microstructural features of a 2205 DSS were investigated and benchmarked to a hot-rolled sample. We find that:\n- 1- Rapid cooling associated with LPBF processing and possible N loss during laser melting result in a non-equilibrium microstructure with an almost fully ferritic microstructure ( /C24 98% ferrite) containing Cr2N precipitates. A post-AM heat treatment at 1000 /C176 C for 10 min produces a balanced ferriticaustenitic microstructure such that the austenite phase fraction increases to /C24 45% and almost all Cr2N precipitates dissolve.\n- 2- At room temperature, the polarisation curves recorded in 1.0 M NaCl solution do not show any significant difference in the pitting corrosion resistance between the as-built LPBF, heat-treated LPBF, and hot-rolled 2205 DSS specimens in terms of pitting potentials and passive current densities\n- despite significant differences in their microstructures in terms of phase composition, precipitation behaviour, and elemental distribution.\n- 3- Atom probe tomography reveals that no depletion of Cr occurs around intragranular Cr2N in LPBF DSS. A deduction in Cr is observed adjacent to intergranular Cr2N particles, however, Cr content in these regions remains above the critical value of 13 wt%.\n- 4- The as-built LPBF 2205 DSS shows a lower critical pitting temperature (CPT) compared to its hot-rolled counterpart (47 /C176 C vs. 61 /C176 C), while post-AM heat treatment results in an enhanced CPT comparable to the hot-rolled specimen (60 /C176 C vs. 61 /C176 C).\n- 5- The significantly lower PREN value for the ferrite phase in the as-built LPBF specimen is identified as the main reason for the low CPT for this specimen, which results in the preferential dissolution of the ferrite phase at temperatures above CPT. Post-AM heat treatment is able to almost equalize the PREN values for austenite and ferrite phases (to values similar to those in the conventional material), and thus enhance the CPT to values comparable to that of the hotrolled sample.",
