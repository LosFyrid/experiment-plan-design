Also carbides precipate but, after three hours at 800°C they are no more evident.\nSensitization susceptibility was investigated by means of Double Loop Electrochemical Reactivation Test (DL-EPR test), Cihal (2001). It allows to perform measurements both in laboratory conditions and in situ, and, compared to the conventional corrosion test, EPR test is quicker, more sensitive and more accurate, especially investigating low sensitized conditions. Two different EPR procedures are usually followed: single loop test (SL-EPR) and double loop test (EPR-DL). In SL-EPR tests, a potential scan from the passive range to open circuit potential is followed. Instead,  in  DL-EPR  tests  a  cyclic  polarization  curve  is  applied  on  a  metallographically  prepared  specimen:  the polarization curve consists in a forward scan followed by a reverse scan starting at the active open circuit potential (Fig. 4). This procedure is standardized for AISI 304 and 304L, ASTM G108 (2015). Considering the DL-EPR test, the sensitization degree of a stainless steel can be evaluated considering the ratio between the area of the reactivation stage and the area of the activation stage (e.g, Q R /QP ).\nAfter 1 hour at 800°C, superduplex 2507 shows only the carbides precipitation (mainly at  but also at  grain boundaries. Longer treatments at 800°C shows the ferrite grains decomposition according to the to the eutectoid reaction  →  +  . After three hours at 800°C, carbides at grains boundaires are still evident, but, after ten hours at 800°C, carbides are no more evident.\nDL-EPR tests were performed according to the following procedure:\n3\n4\n- -after being sensitized, specimens with a surface of 1 cm 2 were metallographically prepared;\n- -Before polarizing the samples, the open circuit potential was measured for 2 min.\n- -a 0.5 M H2 SO4 + 0.01 KSCN aqueous solution was considered, Iacoviello (1997).

Both investigated steels show very low reactivation curves: as a consequence, in both cases it is necessary a second diagram with a different current density axis (Fig. 5 an Fig. 6, on the right).\nFig. 5: Duplex 2205. DL-EPR tests results: activation curves (left); reactivation curves (right).\n5\nFig. 6: Duplex 2507. DL-EPR tests results: activation curves (left); reactivation curves (right).\nIn 2205, the current density peaks of the reactivation curves increase with the sensitization process duration up to 10 hours. For longer sensitization process (100 hours), the current density peak decrease. This can be connected to the microstructure evolution and with the carbides dissolution for longer sensitization processes.\nAnalyzing  the  evolution  of  the  sensitization  peaks  with  the  sensitization  time,  the  superduplex  2507  steel  is characterized by higher values of the Q R /QP ratio, especially for longer sensitization times. This is probably due to the  chemical  composition  influence  on  the  TTT  diagram  and  to  consequent  shorter  incubation  times  for  the precipitation of carbides, nitrides and secondary phases.\nA careful observation of the activation curves of the 2507 stainless steel show some additional activation peaks that are more evident for longer sensitization processes (due to the long list of secondary phases and nitrides that precipitate at high temperature, Fig. 1). The reactivation curves are characterized by an increase of the reactivation peak up to 3 hours, with longer sensitization duration (100 h) that show a peak that is analogous to the peak obtained after 3 hours.\nFig. 7.

It is evident that, considering the duplex stainless steels and the peculiar chemical composition influence on TTT curves, the sensitization index Q R /QP can be considered as characterizing the intergranular corrosion process only as a first approximation, being influenced by the other localized corrosion mechanisms that can occur at the same potentials that characterize the intergranular phenomenon.",
